<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">THE MYSTERIOUS WINDOW</span></h2>
<p>Aroused by a slight noise in the room, Jo Ann
sleepily tossed back the turbulent black curls
from her forehead and slowly opened first one
eye, then the other. She lay staring half dazedly
as the solid doorlike shutters swung back, letting
the rays of the morning sun filter into the room
through the iron bars of the window. Where was
she? Why the iron bars?</p>
<p>Slowly her gaze traveled over the room, taking
in the high, heavily beamed ceiling, the bare
plastered walls, and finally resting on Peggy
sleeping peacefully beside her. Everything
floated again before her mind&rsquo;s eye: their long
trip to Mexico, their midnight arrival at this
great old stone house, and their warm welcome
by Peggy&rsquo;s friend, Florence Blackwell, whom
she had never seen before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>The next moment the Indian woman, who
had wakened her by opening the heavy shutters,
noiselessly crossed the room and began arranging
dishes on a small table beside the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Buenos dias, se&ntilde;orita</i> [Good morning,
miss],&rdquo; she said softly in Spanish as she noticed
that one of the girls was awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;<i>buenos dias</i>,&rdquo; stammered Jo Ann.</p>
<p>Again the woman spoke to her, but Jo Ann
shook her head. After the woman had repeated
her words very slowly, she was able to understand
a few phrases.</p>
<p>Disturbed by their voices, Peggy suddenly sat
up in bed, opening wide her dark-fringed hazel
eyes. She, too, was startled for a moment by the
unfamiliar surroundings; then, noticing the
servant and the expression on Jo Ann&rsquo;s face, she
burst out laughing. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Jo?&rdquo; she
asked teasingly a moment later. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand
what she&rsquo;s saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s trying to tell me something
about Florence, but I&rsquo;m not sure. I wonder
where she is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>Almost simultaneously there burst into the
room a small trim girl with smooth fair hair and
gentian-blue eyes. &ldquo;Good morning, sleepy-heads,&rdquo;
she laughed, dropping down on the foot
of the bed and fanning herself with a large sun
hat. &ldquo;Girls, this is Juana. Did she deliver my
message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She tried to,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
afraid she wasn&rsquo;t very successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to the servant, Florence spoke
rapidly in Spanish.</p>
<p>Juana grinned broadly, bowed to the girls,
and jabbered something they could not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s trying to tell you how happy she is that
you have come to stay with her Florencita,&rdquo; explained
Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her that we&rsquo;re delighted to be here,&rdquo; put
in Peggy promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I envy you&mdash;being able to speak Spanish
that way, Florence,&rdquo; Jo Ann sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
give anything to do half as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence smiled. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get on to it in no
time.&rdquo; As she had lived more than half of her
sixteen years in Mexico, Spanish was perfectly
natural to her. It seemed so simple that sometimes
she found it easier to express herself in
Spanish than in English.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Though I&rsquo;ve studied it two years, I have my
doubts about ever being able to speak it
fluently,&rdquo; said Jo Ann slowly. Noticing Florence&rsquo;s
flushed face she added, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you
been? What time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost ten o&rsquo;clock. I&rsquo;ve just been to market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To market? Why didn&rsquo;t you call us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I knew you girls would be tired and
sleepy after your trip, so I didn&rsquo;t disturb you.
I go to market early every morning. I like to do
the buying myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise you&rsquo;ll call me next time. I didn&rsquo;t
come down here to lie in bed and sleep all the
time. There&rsquo;s too much to do and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then; I&rsquo;ll call you tomorrow. But
come on, let&rsquo;s have breakfast. I&rsquo;m ravenous after
my walk, and I know you two must be starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If having breakfast served in bed is your
idea of our helping you to keep house, then I&rsquo;m
all for it,&rdquo; declared Peggy gaily as she flopped
her pink-pajamed legs over the side of the bed.
&ldquo;It suits my taste exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>Florence nodded smilingly toward Juana. &ldquo;It
wasn&rsquo;t my idea. It was hers. She&rsquo;d be terribly
hurt if we didn&rsquo;t let her wait on us. After you
two get rested from your trip, though, I&rsquo;ll set
you to work planning meals and cooking&mdash;and
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to enjoy being waited on as
long as I can,&rdquo; laughed Peggy.</p>
<p>Sitting on the side of the bed, clad in their
gay pajamas and eating their breakfast from an
exquisitely inlaid tea table, Peggy and Jo Ann
felt very sophisticated indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the most delicious orange juice and
the best toast I&rsquo;ve ever tasted,&rdquo; declared Jo Ann,
a moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best breakfast I&rsquo;ve ever eaten in my
whole life,&rdquo; added Peggy with her usual exaggeration.</p>
<p>Florence turned to the servant, who had just
returned with a plate of hot toast, and repeated
their remarks in Spanish.</p>
<p>From that moment Juana was their devoted
slave, anticipating their every wish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>As soon as they had finished breakfast, Jo
Ann and Peggy dressed for the street, Florence
insisting, much to their disapproval, that they
wear hats. &ldquo;The sun is too hot here in the middle
of the day to go out without something on your
head,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>While Peggy was arranging her hair in neat
auburn waves, Jo Ann, who had finished her
hasty toilet, stepped to the door leading into the
hall and stood taking in every visible detail of
the strangely constructed building. The immense
rooms, each opening onto the long central
hall, seemed dark and gloomy, owing to the
thick walls, the concrete floor, the heavy doors,
and the iron-barred windows. Though the
bright-colored rugs, the gay-flowered chintz,
and a few well-chosen pictures added a cheerful
homelike note, the general effect was one of
austere simplicity.</p>
<p>Having noticed Jo Ann&rsquo;s interest, Florence
came up beside her and, slipping her arm
around her waist, asked, &ldquo;How do you like our
house? It&rsquo;s very old, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I love old houses,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied quickly.
&ldquo;This one is extremely interesting&mdash;so different
from anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo; She hesitated,
then added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking of studying
architecture when I go to college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you care to see the rest of the house?
There are some rather unusual features about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s dark brown eyes sparkled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
adore it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; put in Peggy, who had come out in
time to hear Florence&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>Florence pointed to the open door on the
right. &ldquo;This is the sitting room, but Mother and
I stay in the office with Dad more than in here.
Come on and I&rsquo;ll show you the office.&rdquo; She led
the two girls across the hall, but stopped a moment
later, saying, &ldquo;The office door&rsquo;s closed&mdash;Dad
probably has a patient&mdash;but I can show
you the other rooms. The kitchen is the most interesting
room in the house, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took them into the dining room and on to
the end of the long hall, then turned into an
immense room having three large windows all
heavily barred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness, you could &rsquo;most put our whole
house into this one room!&rdquo; exclaimed Peggy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen such a huge kitchen before in
a private residence. Why do you suppose they
built it so large?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. It&rsquo;s the strangest
house I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Just look at that fireplace,
for instance.&rdquo; Florence motioned toward one
side of the room, which was entirely taken up
by a huge fireplace set back in a broad arched
recess. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s large enough to belong to some big
hotel&mdash;and yet we&rsquo;ve only two bedrooms in the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did they build the fireplace in three
sections? All the fireplaces I&rsquo;ve ever seen were
built on a level with the floor. This one reminds
me of the &lsquo;Three Bears.&rsquo; This section belongs to
the great big bear; and this one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence broke into a peal of laughter at
Peggy&rsquo;s whimsical idea. &ldquo;No one but you would
have thought of that,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Juana glanced up from her preparations for
lunch, smiling to herself. She had not seen her
Florencita happy for months&mdash;not since her
mother had been taken ill and had been sent to
a sanitarium for a several weeks&rsquo; stay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>As their laughter died away, Florence went
on to explain, &ldquo;You see, the lowest section&mdash;in
the middle&mdash;was where they built their fire to
cook the food; this section here, of medium
height, was where they made their <i>tortillas</i>. It&rsquo;s
just the right height for the <i>metate</i>, the stone on
which corn is rubbed or ground into a paste.
There&rsquo;s room here for several women to work
at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what was the great big bear&rsquo;s section
used for?&rdquo; interrupted Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The highest one was used for draining the
dishes and earthen cooking utensils. Each section
is covered with smooth hard stones, and
here in the corner is a small hole left to let the
water drain off. It was a very well-equipped
kitchen in its day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence was delighted to find that her guests
were so interested in the old house which had
been her home for many years. She went on to
explain that although modern equipment had
been installed wherever possible, they had tried
to leave the quaint old atmosphere undisturbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>While she was answering Peggy&rsquo;s questions
about the new equipment, Jo Ann was busily
taking in the details of the architecture, especially
noting the absence of woodwork in the
queer windows that had iron bars and no glass.</p>
<p>As her gaze wandered to the window at the
end of the room, she caught a glimpse of something
which sent a little thrill of excitement over
her. She crossed the room quickly and stared
through the iron bars at what seemed to be the
ruins of an ancient building. Could this be the
ruins of one of those old cathedrals which she
had read about and had wanted to see for so
long?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this old building back of your house,
Florence?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.</p>
<p>Peggy rushed over to the window to see the
building that had caused the note of excitement
in Jo Ann&rsquo;s voice, while Florence merely smiled
and replied, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a part of a very old church,
now used only by the poorest peons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s eyes opened in surprise. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see
how they can use it&mdash;it looks as if it were falling
down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The main part of the church is all right, but
they never use the other part. I don&rsquo;t know
whether it was partially destroyed in a war or
whether it just caved in from old age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old do you think this church is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly, but it&rsquo;s several hundred
years old. I&rsquo;ve heard that it&rsquo;s one of the
oldest buildings in this part of Mexico. All the
better classes of people attend the large modern
cathedral across the Plaza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we go over to the old church? I&rsquo;d love
to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, we&rsquo;ll have time to go over there
before lunch. There isn&rsquo;t much to see, so it won&rsquo;t
take us long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence turned and said something in Spanish
to Juana; then the three girls started out of
the kitchen door. &ldquo;Before we go,&rdquo; Florence
added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you this other room just across
the hall&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing interesting or unusual
about it, though. It has only one window looking
out on the back street. There&rsquo;s nothing but
the back of that old church to be seen from
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>After glancing about this room they hurried
on down to the street, Jo Ann in the lead. She
could scarcely wait to visit the old church.</p>
<p>As they started across the street, Peggy looked
longingly toward the Plaza and the crowded
streets of the business section of the city. She
much preferred sightseeing in that direction,
but she knew Jo Ann had set her heart on seeing
the old church and that there was no changing
her.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the girls passed under the
old stone arch and into the vestibule with its font
of holy water, then walked softly on into the
church.</p>
<p>Having come in from the bright sunlight,
they were unable at first to distinguish anything
except the candles burning on the altar. A reverent
silence lay over the entire building. With
her finger to her lips Florence motioned Jo Ann
and Peggy to a bench. They sat down quietly,
careful lest they disturb the peacefulness of the
place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>As their eyes became accustomed to the dim
interior, they noticed several figures with black
shawls about their heads and shoulders, kneeling
at the altar. A woman with a baby in her
arms and a tiny, half-naked tot beside her was
kneeling before the statue of Mary, Mother of
Jesus, her lips moving in silent prayer. Direst
poverty was evident among all the worshipers.</p>
<p>Many minor details that had escaped Peggy&rsquo;s
eyes caught and held Jo Ann&rsquo;s attention. The
benches, altar rail, and pedestals, she noticed,
were hand hewn and decorated with exquisite
carving; the statues were different from any
that she had ever seen; and even the candles
were unusual&mdash;probably, hand dipped, she decided.</p>
<p>For almost an hour they sat there silent, Jo
Ann intent in absorbing the atmosphere of this
ancient building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I&rsquo;d actually stepped back through
the centuries into the Mexico of ages past,&rdquo; she
thought dreamily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>By this time Peggy had begun to get restless.
To her the place seemed close and stuffy, the
odor and fumes of the candles suffocating.
Without saying a word she rose and went outside.
Leaning against the wall in the shadow of
the stone arch, she waited for the girls and
amused herself by gazing idly at the rear of
Florence&rsquo;s home across the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence, I don&rsquo;t like to make remarks about
your house,&rdquo; she said, half smiling as Florence
and Jo Ann drew near, &ldquo;but from the rear it
looks more like a fort or a prison than a home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It reminds me of an old castle with its high
stone walls and heavy iron bars at the windows,&rdquo;
added Jo Ann, gazing over at the house.</p>
<p>Florence smiled good-naturedly. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t
look very homelike, I&rsquo;ll admit. I don&rsquo;t believe
I&rsquo;ve ever noticed it before from this viewpoint.
I never come to this old church&mdash;at least, I
haven&rsquo;t been here for several years. As I said before,
only people of the lowest classes attend this
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see a window in your hall,&rdquo; Jo Ann
suddenly remarked to Florence. &ldquo;I thought I
noticed a shaded light burning on that little
table at the end of the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a window in the hall&mdash;it&rsquo;s dark
as pitch there, and we have to keep a light burning
day and night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do you account for that little narrow,
crosswise opening up there in the wall?
There it is on a level with the top of the kitchen
and back bedroom windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Florence gazed puzzledly at
the small opening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen a window like
that on the inside of the house, and I know I&rsquo;ve
seen every inch of the walls inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there it is&mdash;a tiny window, just as plain
as the nose on your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In silent amazement Florence stared at this
narrow opening high up in the bleak stone wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly is strange!&rdquo; she said finally,
her brows drawn together in a thoughtful frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; agreed Jo Ann and Peggy,
equally mystified.</p>
<p>Everything was forgotten now except this
queer window. Why was it there? Into what did
it open?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">THE SEARCH BEGINS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This is the strangest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard of,&rdquo;
declared Florence as they hurried back to the
house, eager to examine the rear wall from the
inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you lived here, Florence?&rdquo;
asked Jo Ann. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d have seen that
window long before this if I&rsquo;d been in your
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lived here about eight years, but, as I
told you, I&rsquo;ve only been in that church a few
times, and I&rsquo;ve never walked down that back
street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lived here eight years and never walked
back of your own house!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann in
surprise. &ldquo;Who ever heard of such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Florence replied.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t exactly proper for me to wander down
that back street.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>Both girls opened their eyes wide in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not proper to go back of your own house!&rdquo;
ejaculated Peggy. &ldquo;The very idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you see it&rsquo;s only a narrow street leading
to one of the poorest sections of the city. Only
the very lowest class of people live on it. Mother
and I drive down on the next street sometimes,
accompanied by Felipe, to carry food and
clothes to the destitute families, but I&rsquo;ve never
been down that narrow street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be something like it is on the street
cars at home,&rdquo; Jo Ann said thoughtfully, coming
to Florence&rsquo;s assistance. &ldquo;You know how they
are, Peggy&mdash;one section marked &lsquo;Colored,&rsquo; and
you never sit there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up the long flight of stairs they ran to the
Blackwells&rsquo; apartment, each girl eager to be the
first to solve the mystery. Jo Ann&rsquo;s long legs
carried her ahead of Florence and Peggy, who
arrived a moment later out of breath.</p>
<p>There stood Jo Ann staring blankly at the
solid plastered wall at the end of the hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure this is where that window ought to
be,&rdquo; she said finally in a perplexed tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There certainly isn&rsquo;t any sign of one that I
can see,&rdquo; added Peggy, while Florence gazed
silently at the spot where she thought the opening
should be.</p>
<p>Just then Juana ran in from the kitchen to see
what had caused so much commotion in the silent
old house. &ldquo;Florencita! <i>Que es</i> [What is
it?]?&rdquo; she asked in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; replied Florence in Spanish.
Understanding the superstitious nature of the Indians,
she thought it wiser not to tell Juana
about this mysterious window for the present.</p>
<p>Juana stared in shocked surprise. Something
was wrong, she was sure. Young ladies of the
best families did not deport themselves in such a
manner. Her Florencita had never acted this
way before&mdash;racing into the house like mad.
Finally, shaking her head and mumbling to herself,
she returned to the kitchen to finish her
preparations for lunch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>The moment she disappeared through the
kitchen door, Jo Ann hastened through the one
opposite and called to Florence and Peggy,
&ldquo;Come on, maybe we can see something from the
window in this back room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much to their disappointment, the iron bars,
set in the deep recess of the thick walls, prevented
them from seeing anything except a part
of the ruins of the old church directly across the
narrow street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so the mystery deepens,&rdquo; laughed Jo
Ann. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of bumping your head against
a stone wall, but I&rsquo;ve never understood what it
meant till now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I think it is?&rdquo; remarked
Florence as they wandered back to the hall. &ldquo;At
one time there probably was an opening here&rdquo;&mdash;she
motioned toward the solid wall at the end of
the hall&mdash;&ldquo;then, sometime when they were fixing
the house over, they closed it up. This house is
very, very old, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would they leave a hole on the outside?&rdquo;
Peggy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they probably didn&rsquo;t think it mattered
on that back street, and maybe the stones didn&rsquo;t
fit or something. These walls are so thick, you
know, it wouldn&rsquo;t make any difference. It&rsquo;s too
small to be a window, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; commented Peggy, &ldquo;but it sounds
funny to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann was silent. She was thinking&mdash;thinking
hard. She thoroughly agreed with Florence that
the house was old, but she was sure that the
opening had not been left by a careless mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reason for it,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m going to find out what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Florence&rsquo;s father, Dr. Blackwell, a
tall, distinguished-looking, gray-haired man,
came up the stairs. &ldquo;Good morning, young
ladies,&rdquo; he greeted them pleasantly. &ldquo;You look
quite fresh and rested after keeping such late
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re feeling the best ever,&rdquo; Jo Ann answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you certainly look it,&rdquo; he declared,
glancing from one to the other. &ldquo;Florence, you
have more color in your cheeks than I&rsquo;ve seen for
a long time. Miss Jo and Miss Peggy are having
a good effect on you already.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Daddy, we&rsquo;re having a wonderful time!
But did you know there&rsquo;s a mystery about our
house? We&rsquo;ve just made the queerest discovery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Blackwell laughed. &ldquo;What is it, may I ask&mdash;some
mysterious writing on the wall, or a pot
of gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither. We&rsquo;ve found a window that isn&rsquo;t a
window. It opens on the outside of the house but
not on the inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, that&rsquo;s strange, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he replied
smilingly, as though humoring a small child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Dr. Blackwell, there&rsquo;s a mysterious
window that should open at the end of this hall!&rdquo;
exclaimed Jo Ann, &ldquo;but we can find no trace of
an opening ever having been there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Felipe, combination chauffeur
and house boy, announced lunch, and the subject
was dropped as they all hastened into the dining
room.</p>
<p>Peggy and Jo Ann were surprised to find, after
their late breakfast, that they were quite hungry.
As Felipe and Juana passed back and forth waiting
on the table, Jo Ann thought how convenient
it was to have servants who could not understand
what you said. You didn&rsquo;t have to be nearly as
careful as you did at home with the Negro servants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you girls might like to see something
of our city,&rdquo; Dr. Blackwell remarked as
they were eating their dessert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve arranged for
Felipe to take you for a drive this afternoon. I&rsquo;d
thought I&rsquo;d be able to accompany you, but a
doctor&rsquo;s time&rsquo;s never his own, so I&rsquo;ll have to depend
on Florence and Felipe to show you the
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be fine!&rdquo; exclaimed Peggy. &ldquo;But
we&rsquo;re sorry you can&rsquo;t go with us. Aren&rsquo;t we, Jo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann nodded an emphatic assent and then
went on to remark to Dr. Blackwell, &ldquo;We saw
something very interesting this morning&mdash;the old
church back of your house. I&rsquo;ve been reading
early American history a good deal lately, and
this church seems very much the same type as the
old missions in California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; smiled Dr. Blackwell in surprise.
&ldquo;I thought the modern young girl used
her pretty head solely for thinking of frocks and
furbelows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Peggy laughed. &ldquo;Jo Ann hates dress-up
clothes. She&rsquo;d live in jodhpurs or knickers and
shirts, if her mother didn&rsquo;t make her get out of
them occasionally. Jo&rsquo;s enthusiastic over horses
and dogs and swimming, but her chief hobby is
nosing around old buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much mystery and romance connected
with historic buildings,&rdquo; Jo Ann put in,
shining-eyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re looking for mystery and romance,&rdquo;
Dr. Blackwell remarked, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s plenty of it
to be found in this part of the country&mdash;that is,
if you can only find the key to unlock it. I&rsquo;ve
been so busy studying the ancient system of sanitation&mdash;or
lack of it&mdash;that I&rsquo;ve had no time for
anything of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you get Jo started along that line she&rsquo;ll
never stop,&rdquo; put in Peggy with a teasing glance
at Jo Ann.</p>
<p>Dr. Blackwell smiled. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll turn her
over to a friend of mine&mdash;a prominent lawyer,
who&rsquo;ll be delighted to discuss the early history
of this country with her. You know whom I
mean, Florence&mdash;Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He has the best equipped library in the city,&rdquo;
continued the doctor, &ldquo;and you can dig into the
past to your heart&rsquo;s content, Miss Jo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be wonderful!&rdquo; cried Jo Ann excitedly.
&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ll enjoy meeting him and seeing
his library. I adore books&mdash;especially about
old historic buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they rose from the table Peggy remarked,
&ldquo;Jo and I want to run across the Plaza to buy
some postcards to send home. Do you want to go
with us, Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence and her father exchanged smiling
glances as she replied, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t buy postcards
now&mdash;the stores close for an hour or two in the
middle of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot I&rsquo;m in Mexico,&rdquo; laughed Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In tropical countries it&rsquo;s the custom to take a
siesta after lunch,&rdquo; Dr. Blackwell explained.
&ldquo;People sleep in the hottest part of the day
and do their work in the cool of the evening.
It&rsquo;s a very good custom, too, since the sun has
a tendency to cause fever if one is in it too
much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>On hearing this the girls meekly followed
Florence to their room, and when she removed
her dress and shoes and dropped down on the
bed, they followed her example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How still it is!&rdquo; thought Jo Ann. Not a sound
floated up from the street below; not a leaf
stirred on the trees in the park across the way.
Even nature seemed to be sleeping, so deep, so
intense was the stillness.</p>
<p>Florence, from habit, was soon sound asleep.
The other two girls whispered quietly for a
while; then Peggy&rsquo;s eyelids drooped, and she,
too, succumbed to the restful quiet.</p>
<p>But Jo Ann could not sleep. There were too
many things to think about. A visit to the Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s
library&mdash;she&rsquo;d love that. And that old church
across the street&mdash;there must be some very interesting
facts connected with it. She&rsquo;d find out
more about that later from the Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s books.
But that window! It still puzzled her. There
was something curious about it. What was that
Dr. Blackwell had said about finding the key to
unlock the mystery?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;find the key and unlock
the mystery of this strange window,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Dr. Blackwell be surprised
when I tell him I&rsquo;ve solved it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acting on a sudden impulse she slipped out of
bed quietly so as not to disturb Peggy and Florence.
What she was going to do, she wanted to do
alone. She put on her dress and some rubber-soled
shoes, then, picking up a large sun hat
from a chair, softly opened the door.</p>
<p>There at the head of the stairs sat Felipe,
sound asleep. She hesitated only a moment, then
crept softly past him and on down the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One good thing about these houses is there&rsquo;s
no danger of a loose board or a creaky step giving
you away,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Not a soul was in sight outside&mdash;not even a
dog. Quickly she ran down the street and around
the corner, but drew back as the terrific heat
struck her face. Heat waves radiated from the
cobblestones, and the white stone walls, acting
as double reflectors, turned the narrow street
into a veritable furnace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>But nothing could stop her now. There was
something she wanted to find out about the rear
wall of the house. Pulling her hat down farther
over her face, she squinted her eyes and gazed
up at the glaring white walls above her. Quickly
she scratched three marks on the wall, one directly
below the kitchen window, one beneath
the back room window, and the third beneath the
mysterious opening; then she paced off the distance
between the marks. She was positive now
that she could mark the exact spot on the inner
side of the wall where the opening should be.</p>
<p>Eager to escape from the intense heat, she
hastened back to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew, it&rsquo;s hot!&rdquo; she exclaimed to herself.
&ldquo;These Mexicans show good judgment in sleeping
at this time of the day. I don&rsquo;t blame them in
the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fanning herself with her hat, she dropped
down on the lower step to cool off a moment.
How refreshing was the coolness of the great
hall! She wondered how it was possible to be
so cool here and so hot outside.</p>
<p>She listened intently for a moment, but not a
sound came from above. Apparently everyone
was still asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Softly she slipped up the stairs, step by step,
till she caught a glimpse of the sleeping Felipe
just as she had left him, his chair tipped back
against the wall and his head dropped forward.</p>
<p>There was only one more step now. Holding
her breath, she lifted her foot; then suddenly
there was a loud bumping noise. She was so
startled she almost lost her balance. Clutching at
the wall, she stared before her. Felipe, roused by
some strange instinct, had let his chair down with
a bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no! <i>Muy mal</i> [Very bad]!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
pointing to her face. He patted himself
on the head and talked rapidly in Spanish in an
effort to make her understand that the sun was
&ldquo;bad for the head,&rdquo; as he expressed it.</p>
<p>Much disgusted with herself for getting
caught, and eager to escape, she called back &ldquo;<i>S&iacute;,
s&iacute;</i> [Yes, yes],&rdquo; and hastened on to her room. Now
that her plan to measure the hall had been interrupted,
she would have to wait till a more opportune
time for that. Searching for paper and
pencil, she decided to do the next best thing&mdash;put
the outside measurements down so there&rsquo;d be no
danger of forgetting them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>She was sitting by the window busily drawing
a plan of the house when Florence called in a
surprised voice, &ldquo;Why, Jo Ann! Where have you
been? Your face is as red as a beet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I just went down
and measured the position of those windows on
the back wall. And was it hot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;ve been down there in the
sun!&rdquo; Florence could hardly believe her ears.
&ldquo;Jo, you shouldn&rsquo;t have done that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of voices Peggy opened her eyes,
then sat up in bed to stare at Jo Ann. &ldquo;For goodness&rsquo;
sake, Jo, what&rsquo;ve you been up to now?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; Jo Ann answered crisply. Why
couldn&rsquo;t they leave her alone? She hadn&rsquo;t committed
a crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jo, your face! You&rsquo;re so hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you must know, I&rsquo;ve been searching
for the key with which to unlock the mystery&mdash;as
Dr. Blackwell suggested.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">A NEW DISCOVERY</span></h2>
<p>Looking cool and dainty in their fluffy summer
dresses, the girls came lightly down the
stairs, ready for their drive around the city.</p>
<p>Florence smiled as she noticed the car waiting
at the curb. It had been rubbed and polished till
it shone, and Felipe, beaming like a child with
a favorite toy, was leaning over, brushing a speck
of dust off the hood.</p>
<p>Snatching off his hat on seeing the girls and
grinning widely, he hastened to open the door of
the car; then, standing very straight, he waited
for them to be seated. His effort to uphold the
dignity of his position as chauffeur was amusing.
After tilting his hat&mdash;an old one of Dr. Blackwell&rsquo;s&mdash;at
a rakish angle, he proudly took his
place at the wheel. Although the car was not as
new and expensive as some they passed, he was
sure none carried more beautiful passengers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>To the girls&rsquo; delight it was much cooler now;
soft breezes were stirring, and the heat was vanishing
with the sun, which was sinking behind
the high range of mountains to the west of the
city.</p>
<p>Slowly Felipe passed the cathedral and circled
the attractive little plaza, while the girls gazed
admiringly at the formal beds of brilliant blooming
flowers and drank in the perfumed air,
heavy with the fragrance of wild orange and
oleander. Now and then through the foliage of
the trees they could catch a glimpse of the bandstand
in the center of the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have band concerts two nights a week
here,&rdquo; Florence explained. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll promenade
awhile tomorrow night. I know you&rsquo;ll enjoy
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promenade? What do you mean?&rdquo; asked
Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, walk around the Plaza. On the nights
when the band plays, the people of the better
classes gather here and either promenade around
the broad walk outside the square or sit on the
benches to talk and listen to the music.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds as if it&rsquo;d be lots of fun,&rdquo; approved
Peggy.</p>
<p>At this moment the car came to a sudden stop.
In attempting to turn off the broad drive around
the Plaza into one of the old narrow streets of
the business section, they were held up by the
congested traffic. The enforced rest did not
bother Felipe in the least. Calmly resting his elbows
on the steering wheel, he waited for the
way to become cleared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he blow his horn?&rdquo; asked Jo
Ann. &ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;d make them move.&rdquo; She
noticed, however, that of all the persons in the
near-by cars held up in the traffic jam, not one
seemed the least bit impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These people must have the patience of Job,&rdquo;
said Peggy. &ldquo;If this were at home, you&rsquo;d hear the
horns blowing all down the line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes more than a little thing like this to
ruffle the slow, easy-going Mexican,&rdquo; explained
Florence. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>In a short time they were on their way again,
moving slowly through the narrow, busy streets.
All classes of people and many nationalities were
here, their different modes of dress interesting
Peggy and Jo Ann, as did the stores with their
queer signs and window displays. Although this
was the busiest time of the day, they noticed that
there was none of the bustling rush characteristic
of American cities.</p>
<p>On through the less crowded streets Felipe
steered the car into the residential section, passing
several beautiful cathedrals and small parks,
artistically laid out around the statue of some
noted general or other war hero.</p>
<p>Near the outskirts of the city Jo Ann noticed
with the keenest interest that there were all types
of architecture, from plain stone structures built
centuries ago and looking dull and drab, on to
modern bungalows, gay with bright-tinted stucco
and tiled roofs. Now and then she could catch
glimpses of richly furnished rooms behind the
iron bars of a window, and a flower-adorned
courtyard or patio through an open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love the courtyards,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;The
great arches, the fountain in the center, and the
tropical plants make them beautiful and restful-looking.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are delightful,&rdquo; agreed Florence.
&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez, the lawyer Daddy told you
about, has one of the most beautiful patios in his
house that I&rsquo;ve ever seen. You&rsquo;ll enjoy seeing it
when we go over to see his library. I&rsquo;ve wished
many times that our house had a patio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering why it doesn&rsquo;t, since all
the other old houses have them. There&rsquo;s something
strange about the way your house is built.
I believe when we solve the mystery of that queer
little window, we&rsquo;ll find out some interesting
things about the rest of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the cathedral and the Plaza already?&rdquo;
asked Peggy in surprise just then. &ldquo;How did we
get here so soon? I&rsquo;ve had such a wonderful time
that it seems that we&rsquo;ve only started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask a favor, Florence?&rdquo; asked Jo Ann
as they drove up before the house. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drive
down that street back of your house before we
go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Florence
stammeringly, then stopped, hardly knowing
what to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You said we couldn&rsquo;t walk down there, didn&rsquo;t
you?&mdash;and I do so want to see it,&rdquo; Jo Ann urged.</p>
<p>After talking to Felipe a few moments Florence
answered with a half-apologetic smile,
&ldquo;Felipe says <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i> he&rsquo;ll take us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ma&ntilde;ana?</i>&rdquo; repeated Jo Ann. &ldquo;Oh, you mean
tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s too late now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann turned to Felipe, who was opening the
door for them. &ldquo;<i>Por favor</i>, Felipe,&rdquo; she begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Felipe,&rdquo; added Peggy quickly. She
was not particularly interested in going down
that back street, but it was so pleasant to be out
at this time of the evening that she disliked the
idea of going back into the gloomy house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he&rsquo;ll take us if we insist,&rdquo; translated
Florence a moment later, after talking to Felipe
again. &ldquo;But really, girls, I feel that we shouldn&rsquo;t
go now. It&rsquo;ll be better to go some morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see what difference it&rsquo;d make when
we go. Come on.&rdquo; Jo Ann could not understand
the Mexican&rsquo;s way of putting off till tomorrow
anything he did not care about doing. When she
made up her mind to do a thing, she wanted to do
it <i>right now</i>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s silly to make so much fuss
about such a simple thing,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Why
can&rsquo;t you drive down a street when you want
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;all right,&rdquo; Florence reluctantly
agreed at last.</p>
<p>Dusk was falling as they turned into the cobblestoned
street back of the house. Slowly they
made their way over the stones&mdash;century-old
stones, worn smooth by the tread of many feet.</p>
<p>The farther they drove the more thickly populated
the street became. Jo Ann and Peggy were
shocked by the utter wretchedness and abject
poverty which they saw on all sides. Dirty, half-clad
peons with their empty baskets or trays were
shuffling homeward after their day&rsquo;s labor in
the city; old crippled men and women, who
had begged all day on the streets, were wearily
dragging themselves to a place of shelter for the
night. The small windowless adobe huts which
lined each side of the street seemed overflowing
with people. Women with babies in their arms
squatted in the narrow doorways, while dogs,
pigs, and goats wandered in and out of the houses
at will, as much at home as the children. As for
children, they were everywhere&mdash;dirty, naked,
half-starved looking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never imagined anything could be so terrible,&rdquo;
shuddered Peggy. &ldquo;Did you, Jo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann shook her head soberly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
realize there was such poverty anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shout rose down the street: &ldquo;<i>Americanas!
Americanas!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Children appeared from every direction. They
crowded around the car. Some of the larger ones
climbed up on the running board and the fenders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Centavo, mees! Centavo, mees</i> [A penny,
miss! A penny, miss]!&rdquo; they cried, holding up
dirty, scrawny little hands to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Florence!&rdquo; begged Jo Ann. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop
and give them something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we stopped now, we&rsquo;d never be able to start
again.&rdquo; Florence explained quickly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d
climb all over us. Let&rsquo;s throw some pennies out
the windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurriedly they emptied their purses of all the
pennies they could find and threw them far into
the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Such shouting and scrambling as followed!
The children fought and knocked each other
down in their effort to find the pennies, the tiniest
ones crying because they could get nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pitiful&mdash;heartrending&mdash;these children
fighting over pennies as starved little animals
over a bone,&rdquo; thought Jo Ann. How was it possible
for such things to exist, almost at your very
door, and yet to be absolutely unseen and unknown?
Was this really a part of the beautiful
city they had enjoyed seeing such a short time
ago?</p>
<p>Felipe could scarcely drive without hitting
some of the children, yet he dared not stop. He
had not wanted to bring the girls down here, as
he felt sure Dr. Blackwell would object, but since
they were here he must take care of them. While
the children were busily searching for the scattered
pennies, Felipe managed to escape the
crowd. Quickly he drove to the end of the street
and turned down an old, dry, rocky river bed, the
car bumping and swaying as it sped along over
the rough cobblestones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; shouted Jo Ann above the noise as
she clung to the side of the car to keep from falling
over on Florence. &ldquo;I take back everything&mdash;I
said&mdash;about you coming down&mdash;here alone. I
understand&mdash;a lot that I thought foolish&mdash;before
I saw this with my very own eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have to go far&mdash;on this rough river
bed,&rdquo; Florence called back a moment later.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll turn&mdash;at the next corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the&mdash;widest river bed I ever saw&mdash;to
have so little water in it,&rdquo; put in Peggy above the
noise.</p>
<p>As the car turned into the next street Florence
replied, &ldquo;Sometimes when it rains hard in the
mountains this river&rsquo;s full of water.&rdquo; She paused
and added, &ldquo;This is the street Mother and I&rsquo;ve
come down frequently to bring clothing for the
poor families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then some ragged little children near by
began to wave their hands and call out, &ldquo;<i>La
Se&ntilde;orita! La Se&ntilde;orita!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence smiled and waved back. &ldquo;Those are
some of the children we&rsquo;ve given clothes. They
look as if they need some more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had some pennies to give to these
children, too,&rdquo; said Jo Ann. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s come back
here sometime and bring them something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few more minutes the adobe huts were
left behind, and they began passing the plain
stone houses of the middle class. With long-drawn
sighs the girls settled back against the
cushions, each thinking of the distressing poverty
she had seen.</p>
<p>Suddenly down the street directly in front of
them Jo Ann spied a tall, ungainly object against
the high stone wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Florence?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That? Oh, that&rsquo;s a scaffold the workmen are
using in doing some repair work on a house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t they use ladders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d have a time to get a ladder long
enough to reach the top of these houses. When
they build them, they use big derricks to lift the
heavy stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do they build their houses so
high?&rdquo; asked Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes them cool,&rdquo; Florence answered as
the car turned off the narrow street onto the
pavement around the Plaza.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re almost home!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann
in surprise. &ldquo;Is it possible that this is part of your
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, but it&rsquo;s all connected into one
long building,&rdquo; she replied, wondering at Jo
Ann&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then that&rsquo;s the very thing!&rdquo; Jo Ann cried,
beaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever are you talking about, Jo?&rdquo; asked
Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how to get up on top of the house, of
course! Don&rsquo;t you see&mdash;I can climb up that
scaffold to the top of the house; then it&rsquo;ll be easy
to let a rope down to the mysterious window. I&rsquo;ve
been wondering how I&rsquo;d ever get on top of the
house&mdash;it&rsquo;s so high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jo, you can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; gasped Florence
in alarm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too high, and anyway&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to do it,&rdquo; declared Peggy
emphatically. &ldquo;You might get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; scoffed Jo Ann. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
broken my neck yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it isn&rsquo;t your fault,&rdquo; Peggy retorted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jo, suppose someone should see you!&rdquo;
exclaimed Florence. &ldquo;You must give up this
foolish idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it be a disgrace if someone did see
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t considered proper here for a
young lady to do anything on the street which
would attract attention. You&rsquo;d be a regular circus,
climbing that scaffold. The street&rsquo;d be
jammed with people before you&rsquo;d get halfway
to the top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise not to give a free performance
for the natives,&rdquo; laughed Jo Ann. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s to
keep me from climbing up there when I
wouldn&rsquo;t have an audience? There are times, you
know, when people sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t go out in the street at night&mdash;alone!&rdquo;
The very idea of such a thing was shocking
to Florence. &ldquo;That scaffold&rsquo;s nothing but
some rough poles fastened to the wall, and it&rsquo;s so
high it&rsquo;d be dangerous&mdash;not at all like climbing
a ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>The car drew up before the house, and Florence
and Peggy jumped out and hurried up the
stairs without waiting for Felipe to open the
door for them, but Jo Ann lingered a moment to
thank him for granting her request. She knew he
couldn&rsquo;t understand a word she said, but from
the broad grin which spread over his face she
felt she had made her meaning clear to him.</p>
<p>The ride had meant much more to her than she
had expected, since she had discovered a way of
getting up on the roof. All she needed now was
a length of rope so she could lower herself from
the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t going to be hard to do,&rdquo; she told herself
as she went up the stairs. Of course, she
would not do anything to disgrace Florence or
Dr. Blackwell&mdash;they had been so kind to her&mdash;but
give it up now? Never! Not with her goal
almost in sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">JO ANN&rsquo;S SECRET QUEST</span></h2>
<p>According to her promise to take the girls to
the market with her, Florence called Peggy and
Jo Ann the next morning as soon as she awoke.
It was only half-past six, but the sun was already
making a geometric pattern across the floor
where it shone through the iron bars of the window.</p>
<p>Jo Ann was impatient to start the minute she
had finished dressing. Yesterday she had looked
forward to the trip only because it would be
interesting, but now she was eager to find a store
where she could buy the rope she needed for
exploring the mysterious window. She knew that
it would be difficult to make this purchase without
Florence&rsquo;s finding out about it, but if she
could only find where to get the rope she could
return later, alone, and buy it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hurry up, Peg,&rdquo; scolded Jo Ann as she
stood in the doorway, waiting. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve primped
long enough. We&rsquo;re just going to market&mdash;no
one&rsquo;ll see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the hurry?&rdquo; calmly inquired
Peggy as she patted the waves of her auburn hair
into place. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt your appearance
any if you spent a little more time primping, as
you call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I were as fussy as you are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Jo
Ann began; then, leaving the sentence unfinished,
she disappeared into the hall. There was
no use arguing with Peggy. She just wouldn&rsquo;t
hurry&mdash;every hair must be in place.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, when Peggy and Florence
joined her in the hall, Jo Ann asked with a
meaning glance toward Felipe, who was waiting
with a split-cane basket on his arm, &ldquo;Do we have
to take him along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; he always goes with me to carry
the basket,&rdquo; explained Florence in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry the basket for you, and we won&rsquo;t
need him,&rdquo; Jo Ann volunteered quickly.</p>
<p>Florence shook her head vigorously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not a servant, Jo. I wouldn&rsquo;t think of letting you
carry the basket. That would never do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;all right, then. Just as you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although she had smilingly agreed with Florence,
she realized that it would be more difficult
to carry out her plan with Felipe along. His keen
eyes saw everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Felipe reminds me of a faithful watchdog,&rdquo;
she remarked as they started down the stairs.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he can&rsquo;t understand English&mdash;there&rsquo;s
some consolation in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This would complicate matters considerably,
having Felipe along; still, she could not say more
about leaving him at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just eager to be of service, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; explained
Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should&rsquo;ve seen him yesterday when he
caught me slipping up the stairs. You&rsquo;d have
thought he was a contortionist or something,
from all the motions he went through in trying
to tell me the sun was bad for my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can easily imagine how he looked,&rdquo; smiled
Florence. &ldquo;He is comical when he gets excited.
I hope you girls don&rsquo;t mind walking,&rdquo; she added
as they reached the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t mind, only I won&rsquo;t be responsible
for my appetite when we get back,&rdquo; replied
Peggy lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;ll be wonderful to walk this morning,&rdquo;
put in Jo Ann. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so cool and pleasant,
and we can see more when we walk&mdash;not that I
don&rsquo;t like to ride, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the sun was painting the tops of the
buildings with gold, the narrow tunnel of a
street still held the cool freshness of the night.
As Jo Ann drew in deep breaths of the invigorating
morning air, she wondered what Florence
would say if she knew her real reason for wanting
to walk.</p>
<p>Chatting gaily, they strolled arm in arm, while
Felipe followed a short distance behind.</p>
<p>All along the way there were many curious,
interesting things that caught both Peggy&rsquo;s and
Jo Ann&rsquo;s attention&mdash;peons with trays or baskets
either balanced on their heads or set on little
portable stands; women squatting on the sidewalks
selling flowers and fruits, <i>tortillas</i>, <i>tamales</i>,
and other foods; beggars waiting on every corner
trying to rouse the sympathy of the shoppers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>While the lively, talkative Peggy plied Florence
with question after question about the people
and their strange customs, Jo Ann had an
opportunity to peer into each of the queer little
shops they passed. She even stared at all the little
stands in the street, almost expecting to see a
rope dangling from one of them, so intent was
she upon her search. Even though everything
imaginable seemed offered for sale, she found
nothing that in any way resembled a rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do they sell rope in this curious
place?&rdquo; she wondered. If she could persuade
Florence to return home along another street,
perhaps she&rsquo;d find a store there where she could
get it.</p>
<p>Her perplexing problems were forgotten a
moment later as the market loomed before them.
It was a huge old building occupying an entire
block. The immense roof was supported by heavy
stone columns and broad arches which showed
signs of having been, at one time, tinted in bright
colors but now looked dull and faded. The
plaster was cracked and soiled, and in places
great slabs had fallen off, leaving the bare stones
exposed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I love this!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one
of the most interesting places I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The
people&mdash;their dress&mdash;their customs&mdash;the very atmosphere
is different. It&rsquo;s hard to realize this is
the twentieth century when you look around
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is very old and much the same as it
was centuries ago,&rdquo; replied Florence.</p>
<p>Stalls had been set up in every inch of available
space inside the building. Some were piled
high with golden tropical fruits&mdash;oranges, mangoes,
guavas, bananas, pineapples; others were
festooned with strings of onions, garlic, and red
chili peppers&mdash;all very necessary to add a piquant
flavor to the limited fare of the Mexican.</p>
<p>Slowly they made their way along the narrow,
crowded passageways between the stalls, Peggy
and Jo Ann stopping every few minutes to question
Florence about the different things they
saw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Finally, after glancing at her watch, Florence
stopped abruptly and exclaimed, &ldquo;Gracious! It&rsquo;s
after nine o&rsquo;clock&mdash;I&rsquo;ll never get through at this
rate&mdash;not if I stop to answer all of Peggy&rsquo;s
numerous questions.&rdquo; She laughed and gave
Peggy&rsquo;s arm an affectionate pat. &ldquo;Would you
girls like to wander around and take in the sights
while I finish my marketing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;d love to,&rdquo; promptly answered Jo
Ann. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t we, Peg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re sure you don&rsquo;t mind being left
alone, I&rsquo;ll hurry on. Stay in this section of the
building so I can find you.&rdquo; In a moment Florence
and the faithful Felipe disappeared in the
crowd.</p>
<p>Jo Ann was delighted to be free to carry on
her search for a rope without fear of being questioned.
Although she felt sure that Peggy would
enter into her plans, she decided not to tell her
about them just yet.</p>
<p>Grabbing her by the arm, Jo Ann jostled and
pushed their way through the crowd, up one aisle
and down another.</p>
<p>Suddenly the breathless Peggy halted. &ldquo;Say&mdash;where&rsquo;s
the fire?&rdquo; she scolded. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a
thing, trying to keep up with you. Why the
rush?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurry so fast,&rdquo;
Jo Ann replied; then, realizing she dared not
waste time arguing if she was to accomplish
what she had started out to do, she added, &ldquo;Can
you keep a secret, Peg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret!&rdquo; repeated Peggy staring at her in
surprise. &ldquo;Of course I can&mdash;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m trying to find a shop or a store&mdash;or
whatever it is&mdash;where you buy rope in this place.
You see, all I need is a rope&mdash;then I can explore
the mysteries on the other side of that curious
window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why so secretive about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Peggy
stopped abruptly, it having dawned on her why
Jo Ann had acted so strangely all the morning.
&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you didn&rsquo;t want Felipe along, is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he gets on my nerves. All the way here
I could feel his eyes boring into my back every
time I craned my neck to see something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re imagining things, Jo. It&rsquo;s just your
guilty conscience. He&rsquo;s really the perfect servant&mdash;very
quiet and accommodating, but not inquisitive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right&mdash;but still I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s
out of the way. Come on, we&rsquo;ll have to hurry, or
they&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo; She caught hold of Peggy&rsquo;s arm
to keep from getting separated in the crowd,
then continued, &ldquo;You remember how horrified
Florence was yesterday when I mentioned my
plan to climb that scaffold&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t want
her to find out what I&rsquo;m doing. It&rsquo;d only worry
her, and I have no intention of giving it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dubious expression crept into Peggy&rsquo;s hazel
eyes. &ldquo;I still think you&rsquo;re foolish to risk breaking
your neck for something no more important than
a hole in a wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never can tell, though, what might be
behind the hole,&rdquo; said Jo Ann with an air of
mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jo, how&rsquo;re you going to get a rope without
Florence&rsquo;s seeing it? It&rsquo;ll make a bulky-looking
package, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it does, I won&rsquo;t get it now. If we can only
find where to buy it, we can slip back later.
You&rsquo;ve got to help me get it without Florence&rsquo;s
and Felipe&rsquo;s seeing it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all right, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to do it
if you&rsquo;re determined to go on with your plans&mdash;but
really I feel terrible about doing anything
Florence doesn&rsquo;t approve of. She and her
father&rsquo;ve been so lovely to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to do anything to disgrace
them. I wouldn&rsquo;t do that for anything. I really
feel that they won&rsquo;t object at all after I&rsquo;ve solved
the mystery. Florence is just afraid I might get
hurt climbing up on that roof. You know well
enough I&rsquo;ve done lots more dangerous things
many a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly spying an Indian woman with a basket
of exquisite roses, Peggy stopped, saying,
&ldquo;Forget about your old rope for a minute, Jo,
and help me buy some of these beautiful roses.
Aren&rsquo;t they the most gorgeous things you&rsquo;ve ever
seen? Ask her how much they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann quickly raked her memory for the
proper Spanish words to use in buying the
flowers. &ldquo;<i>Cuanto rosas?</i>&rdquo; she asked finally.</p>
<p>While talking rapidly in Spanish, the woman
picked up a long-stemmed, beautifully shaped
bud of shell-pink color edged with silver, and
then held up three fingers of her left hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She says they&rsquo;re three <i>centavos</i> each,&rdquo; explained
Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her I&rsquo;ll take a dozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Un dosena</i>,&rdquo; she repeated in Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all you do&mdash;just add an a to the
English words&mdash;rose-a, dozen-a? I could do
that,&rdquo; laughed Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever think it&rsquo;s that simple, but there
are several Spanish words which are much
like the same words in English,&rdquo; Jo Ann explained,
feeling quite proud of her superior
knowledge.</p>
<p>As the woman had seldom sold more than
three or four flowers at a time, she had great
difficulty now in figuring the cost of a dozen.
Finally Jo Ann offered her assistance, and after
arguing for some little time, Peggy received her
change and the roses, and they started on their
way again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious! I feel like a bride with all these
flowers,&rdquo; laughed Peggy. &ldquo;Suppose you take half
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;that&rsquo;s the very thing.&rdquo; Jo Ann&rsquo;s
eyes sparkled. &ldquo;If I can only find the rope now,
I can carry the bundle under these flowers, and
it won&rsquo;t be noticed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later Peggy called to Jo Ann to stop
again. &ldquo;Just look at these beautiful blankets!
Feel how soft they are and see how beautifully
the colors are blended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are lovely. I&rsquo;ve heard that they&rsquo;re
all hand made by the natives&mdash;that the designs
are handed down in the families for generations.
But, Peg, we haven&rsquo;t time to stop here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look at that blanket hanging over there!
It looks like the rainbow, the way the colors are
shaded into each other. Don&rsquo;t you love it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On receiving no answer from Jo Ann, Peggy
turned around just in time to see her disappear
in the crowd. Quickly she began pushing her
way to the spot where she had last seen her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t relish the idea of getting lost in this
crowd of people who can&rsquo;t understand a single
word I say,&rdquo; she told herself, as she darted in
and out among the slow, deliberate Mexicans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>After looking about in all directions, to her
great relief she spied Jo Ann standing before an
enclosed booth, piled high with baskets, <i>sombreros</i>,
hand-made chairs, and various other
articles. Coming nearer she saw what had attracted
Jo Ann&rsquo;s attention&mdash;several long coils
of rope hanging near the back of the booth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jo Ann Cutrer, what do you mean by running
off like that!&rdquo; she scolded.</p>
<p>With only a nod at Peggy, Jo Ann stood gazing
at the rope, her forehead wrinkled in deep
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of
the Spanish word for rope. What can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you add an a to rope as you did
before,&rdquo; suggested Peggy, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rope-a, rope-a,&rdquo; repeated Jo Ann several
times; then her face brightened. &ldquo;I believe that is
the word. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve heard that word before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to the man in charge of the booth, she
repeated in Spanish, &ldquo;<i>Cuanto la ropa?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked amazed at first, then stared
blankly at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want <i>la ropa</i>,&rdquo; she repeated impatiently.</p>
<p>With a shrug of his shoulders, the man shook
his head and pointed to another booth farther
down the aisle. The next moment his face brightened,
and, reaching over, he handed her a basket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann, frowning more
deeply than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re
saying, Jo,&rdquo; Peggy suggested, smiling. &ldquo;Maybe
that&rsquo;s not the right word for rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; Jo Ann
replied.</p>
<p>Turning to the man again, she pointed to the
back of the booth behind a stack of <i>sombreros</i>.
&ldquo;See, I want that rope back there.&rdquo; A broad
smile spread over his bronze face as he picked
up several of the hats and handed them to her.</p>
<p>Jo Ann shook her head vehemently. &ldquo;No&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the only thing left near the hats was the
coil of rope hanging on a peg behind them, he
handed her the rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;, s&iacute;</i>,&rdquo; she replied, and reached over to take
the rope from him. &ldquo;How much is it?&rdquo; she asked
in Spanish.</p>
<p>As soon as he replied she answered promptly,
&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; and handed it back to him
to be wrapped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>To her amazement he unfastened the coil and
spread the rope out before her to show her how
long it was, then jerked on it to show its strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;, s&iacute;</i>&mdash;that&rsquo;s all right, but wrap it up&mdash;and
hurry, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the slowest person I ever saw,&rdquo; she murmured
to Peggy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Florence&rsquo;ll find
us before I get it wrapped. I hardly think she&rsquo;ll
notice it under these roses, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the Mexican handed her the rope
without any sign of wrapping and with one long
end dangling from the loose coil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jo, look!&rdquo; Peggy put in quickly, pointing to
the next booth. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t wrap their packages
here. That&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrors! I can&rsquo;t carry it this way&mdash;what&rsquo;ll I
do? I&rsquo;d like to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped suddenly as a
familiar voice behind her exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, here
you are! I&rsquo;ve been searching everywhere for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann dropped the rope as if it were a hot
coal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was beginning to think you girls were lost,&rdquo;
Florence went on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not lost, just misplaced,&rdquo; put in Peggy
quickly to cover Jo Ann&rsquo;s confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ll have to hurry now,&rdquo; Florence
urged. &ldquo;I know Juana&rsquo;s had breakfast waiting
for us for a long time.&rdquo; She turned and led the
way out of the market.</p>
<p>When they had gone only a few steps, Jo Ann
suddenly gave a little gasp and catching Peggy
by the arm exclaimed in a low voice, &ldquo;Gee! I
made a ridiculous mistake. I&rsquo;ve just remembered
what the word <i>ropa</i> means&mdash;it&rsquo;s clothes. I was
asking the man for clothes! No wonder he
couldn&rsquo;t understand what I meant!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">THE SIESTA HOUR</span></h2>
<p>All the way home from the market Jo Ann
kept wondering what excuse she would make to
Florence so that she might go back after the
rope.</p>
<p>To her delight the opportunity came sooner
than she expected. While the three girls were at
the table lingering over their late breakfast, Felipe
entered with a message for Florence from
her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy needs my help for about half an hour
in the office,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I often assist him
in the simple cases. You girls amuse yourselves
any way you wish while I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Peggy answered promptly. &ldquo;I
believe I&rsquo;ll run across the Plaza to that curio
store we saw yesterday and buy some postcards.
I&rsquo;d like to look at the curios, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The sun&rsquo;s getting so hot now that you&rsquo;d better
carry my parasol, if you&rsquo;re going out,&rdquo; Florence
suggested over her shoulder as she left the
room.</p>
<p>Although Jo Ann had not said a word, she
immediately decided that here was her chance
to go back to the market after the rope.</p>
<p>Jo Ann got the parasol and then hastened out
the door, Peggy at her heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to the market for the rope first
before we go to the curio store,&rdquo; Jo Ann suggested
as soon as they reached the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but let&rsquo;s hurry so I&rsquo;ll be sure to
have time to stop and get the cards,&rdquo; replied
Peggy.</p>
<p>When they reached the market the crowd had
thinned considerably, and without much difficulty
they found the booth and bought the rope.</p>
<p>Peggy smiled widely as they left the booth
and remarked teasingly, &ldquo;I notice you didn&rsquo;t ask
for <i>ropa</i> this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann grinned good-naturedly. &ldquo;No, I
looked it up in my dictionary and found the
right word for rope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>As it had taken longer to make the trip than
they had anticipated, Jo Ann hurried Peggy
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get this rope inside the house and
hidden before Florence finishes helping her
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as they turned the corner by the Plaza,
Jo Ann halted abruptly. &ldquo;Peg, look, standing
there in the doorway&mdash;Felipe! I can&rsquo;t go past
him, carrying the rope loose like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you, Jo. We&rsquo;ve forgotten the
postcards. Let&rsquo;s go to the store and get them, and
maybe by the time we get back he&rsquo;ll be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To their vexation, when they returned to the
same corner fifteen minutes later, they found
that Felipe was still standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Peg! The watchdog is still there. I&rsquo;m
not going to throw this rope away now that I&rsquo;ve
got this near home with it. What shall I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She stopped abruptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it! I&rsquo;ll slip it inside
the parasol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting her words into action, she closed the
parasol and slipped the coil of rope inside.</p>
<p>Peggy laughed, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a funny-looking parasol,
I must say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if it is funny. You walk close to
me, and I&rsquo;ll carry the parasol between us. Now,
how&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I suppose&mdash;only I&rsquo;m sure Felipe is
wondering why we&rsquo;re not carrying it over our
heads as we&rsquo;re supposed to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an effort to conceal their amusement,
they hurried on past Felipe and up to their room.</p>
<p>Quickly snatching the rope from its hiding
place, Jo Ann threw it into her trunk and
slammed the lid down with a bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad that much is done,&rdquo;
she remarked with a sigh of satisfaction. &ldquo;I hope
I don&rsquo;t have as much trouble using this rope as
I&rsquo;ve had getting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as she spoke these words she began
thinking of the many problems she still had to
solve before she could reach the mysterious window.
Would she be able to climb the crude
scaffold? How would she be able to fasten
the rope after she got to the roof? And how
could she manage to do all this without being
seen?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>All through lunch and later that afternoon
during the siesta hour these questions kept racing
through her mind.</p>
<p>Just as they had done the day before, Florence
and Peggy quickly succumbed to the heavy,
drowsy stillness. But not Jo Ann. The harder
she tried to sleep, the more wide awake she became.</p>
<p>Finally in desperation she got up and sat gazing
out of the window. How could she stand this
quiet and inaction so long? Glancing down at
her watch, she realized it would be at least an
hour before Florence and Peggy were awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even being outdoors in the hot sun&rsquo;s better
than sitting here doing nothing,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>No sooner had this thought entered her mind
than she decided to go outside and examine the
scaffold on the building at the end of the block.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take only a few minutes, and I&rsquo;ll be
back before the girls are awake,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Quickly she rose and slipped noiselessly out of
the room and past the sleeping Felipe at the head
of the stairs. Once outside she hastened on around
the corner and looked anxiously down the street
to the farther end of the block to see if the scaffold
were still there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good! It&rsquo;s there!&rdquo; she exclaimed to herself
the next moment.</p>
<p>Without a thought about the extreme heat she
ran down the street to the corner. As she gazed
up at the high, crude scaffold made of peeled
poles fastened together, a slight tinge of fear
passed over her. How high it looked! And what
a blank wall it was fastened on! There wasn&rsquo;t a
sign of a window or opening&mdash;not even a ledge&mdash;to
break the smooth, regular surface of the
wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the crudest scaffold I&rsquo;ve ever laid eyes
on,&rdquo; she thought, as she examined the hardwood
poles which were fastened to the wall in several
places by wooden pegs.</p>
<p>Near the top of the poles she noticed that there
was a rough platform from which dangled a
long rope with a bucket attached to the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how the workmen get up to that
platform,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Going over to the other side of the scaffold she
discovered that deep notches had been cut at
regular intervals in one of the poles, for footholds.
&ldquo;So this is the way they get up! These
notches look awfully far apart, though. I wonder
if I could reach them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carefully she pulled herself up to the first
notch, and then on to the second and third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I can climb this!&rdquo; she exulted. &ldquo;This is
more fun than I&rsquo;ve had in a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up she climbed to the platform and then
scrambled over onto it.</p>
<p>While she was sitting there resting a moment,
she was busily examining the rest of the scaffold
to see if she could reach the top of the building.
She noticed that, although there were no more
notches cut in the pole, there was a crosspiece
near the top to hold the scaffold in position
against the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can only reach that crosspiece, I know I
can climb up on the roof,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>Cautiously she rose and, wrapping her legs
and arms around the pole, slowly pulled herself
up to the crosspiece; then balancing herself on it
she climbed over the edge of the roof.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>However, hot as she was, she knew that she
had no time to cool off, since the siesta hour was
almost over, and the girls would soon be awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must not get caught again,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>She looked hastily around the curious roof,
noting with surprise that it resembled a flat cement
floor with a low, thick stone wall around it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How on earth can I fasten a rope to a roof
like this?&rdquo; she asked herself in dismay. &ldquo;While
I&rsquo;m up here I&rsquo;ve just got to see the roof over that
mysterious window. If it&rsquo;s like this, what will I
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurrying to the division wall, she scrambled
over it, only to be confronted by another wall.
Undaunted, she climbed over it, and then over
still another, till she came in sight of a chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be the chimney of the big fireplace
in the kitchen,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>Climbing up on the broad outer wall of the
roof she peered over, trying to find the position
of the mysterious window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they have window casings or
something to show where their windows are?&rdquo;
she thought in disgust.</p>
<p>She lay flat on her stomach and leaned farther
out over the edge of the building. Although the
hot stones burned her, she kept on persistently
examining the surface of the wall below till she
made out the outlines of the mysterious opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; she exclaimed aloud. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m
scorched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang down quickly, took a pin out of her
hair, and tried to scratch a mark with it on the
wall directly in line with the window. To her
disgust the hairpin proved to be too frail a tool
to have any effect upon the old plaster of the
wall. Tossing the pin away, she looked about for
some other object with which to mark the spot,
but on finding nothing she hurried off toward the
scaffold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to rush, or the girls&rsquo;ll be awake and
miss me,&rdquo; she told herself as she vaulted the first
division wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>In a surprisingly short time she reached the
end of the building. Leaning over the wall, she
looked about for the crosspiece on which she
must get a foothold before sliding down to the
platform below.</p>
<p>The next instant she gasped and drew back.
Surely her eyes were deceiving her.</p>
<p>Cautiously she peeped over the wall again.
Yes, there on the platform only a few feet beneath
her sat a Mexican with a bucket of paint
beside him. Just then loud, coarse laughter
sounded from the street, and peering down she
saw several workmen applauding one of their
number who, poised at the bottom of the scaffold,
was dramatizing a love scene. Pulling out
a piece of white material from his girdle, he
pressed it first to his lips, then to his heart, talking
rapidly all the time.</p>
<p>Only two words floated up to her&mdash;<i>se&ntilde;orita</i>
and <i>amor</i>. As the actor waved the white material
in response to the applause, an expression
of consternation came into Jo Ann&rsquo;s eyes. That
was her handkerchief! She must have dropped
it when she was climbing. The se&ntilde;orita of this
silly farce was no other than herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Horrified, she drew back out of sight. What
must she do now? She dared not climb down
with those awful men there. If her handkerchief
had caused such guffawing, what would happen
when they saw her?</p>
<p>Alarmed by these thoughts, she fled back
toward the chimney. It would offer a little shelter,
at least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a mess I&rsquo;ve made of things!&rdquo; she
thought as she ran. &ldquo;Peggy&rsquo;s right about my curiosity
getting me in trouble. I&rsquo;m in it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huddling behind the chimney in an effort to
hide from the workmen should they come up on
the roof, and to escape the direct rays of the sun,
she racked her brain for a way to get out of this
predicament without disgracing herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must not do anything that will hurt Florence
or her father,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Florence
said it would never do for a girl to do anything
that&rsquo;d attract attention in any way. If I were
back home and these were American workmen,
I wouldn&rsquo;t have a bit of trouble getting out of
this predicament. But down here&mdash;! I&rsquo;d have a
time trying to make them understand me. They
might think I was crazy or something, but I
wouldn&rsquo;t care if it weren&rsquo;t for the Blackwells.
There must be some way out of this embarrassing
situation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>At the same time that Jo Ann was puzzling
over her problem Peggy was arousing from her
siesta. With half-opened eyes, she stretched lazily
and looked about the room. Florence was beginning
to stir, but where was Jo Ann?</p>
<p>&ldquo;These lazy, quiet hours are hard on a girl of
Jo&rsquo;s temperament,&rdquo; Peggy mused. &ldquo;I wonder
where she is and what she&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment Florence sat up, yawned two
or three times, then asked drowsily, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Jo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to know. I just woke up
and discovered the bird had flown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she got tired waiting for us to wake
up and went down to the drugstore for a drink.
She ought to be back in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Florence slipped out of bed she remarked
tentatively, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve planned a shopping tour for
this afternoon. I thought you&rsquo;d be interested in
seeing some of the souvenirs and drawnwork in
the stores.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d love it,&rdquo; replied Peggy promptly, rising
at once. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hurry and get ready so we&rsquo;ll
have a long time to shop. I want to get some of
those dainty little handkerchiefs like you sent me
for my birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you like them. The Mexicans
really do beautiful handwork, but unless you see
something you especially want this afternoon,
you&rsquo;d better wait and get the handkerchiefs directly
from the women who make them. They&rsquo;ll
be much cheaper that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half-hour later Peggy announced proudly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all ready&mdash;how about you? Don&rsquo;t you think
it&rsquo;s time Jo was back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s keeping her. I&rsquo;ll
ask Felipe how long she&rsquo;s been gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Florence returned a few minutes later
there was a look of bewilderment on her face.
&ldquo;Felipe says he hasn&rsquo;t seen her,&rdquo; she announced.</p>
<p>Peggy&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. &ldquo;Where do you
suppose she can be, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; replied Florence,
shaking her head dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose&mdash;she surely wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world are you talking about?&rdquo;
broke in Florence, seeing the alarm on Peggy&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just wondering if she&rsquo;d slipped down
that back street again. She can&rsquo;t get that mysterious
window out of her mind, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, but, surely, after getting caught
yesterday, she wouldn&rsquo;t risk it again. I&rsquo;m afraid
for her to be in the sun so much when she&rsquo;s not
used to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jo doesn&rsquo;t really mean to do anything that
isn&rsquo;t right,&rdquo; Peggy defended, &ldquo;but when she
makes up her mind, there&rsquo;s no stopping her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little frown appeared on Florence&rsquo;s forehead.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really worried about her going on
with this scheme. I don&rsquo;t see how she can carry
it out without being in great danger. Isn&rsquo;t there
some way you could persuade her to give it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She isn&rsquo;t afraid of anything, and she&rsquo;s the
most determined person I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into Dad&rsquo;s office and out on his balcony
so we can watch for her,&rdquo; suggested Florence
a moment later. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll surely be back in a
few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give her a piece of my mind,&rdquo;
fumed Peggy. &ldquo;She ought to know better than
to go off that way. Something might happen to
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking in every direction, the girls were dismayed
at seeing no signs of Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to have disappeared in thin air,&rdquo;
said Peggy anxiously. &ldquo;Something must be
wrong. She wouldn&rsquo;t stay away this long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously Florence turned her
head, listening. &ldquo;What was that? Didn&rsquo;t you hear
someone whistle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment a faint but distinct whistling
note sounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Jo&rsquo;s whistle,&rdquo; exclaimed Peggy. &ldquo;But
where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo; called a low voice. &ldquo;Up on the
roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; The girls gasped in amazement.</p>
<p>Blankly they stared above them as a red,
flushed face, framed with tousled hair, peeped
over the edge of the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world are you doing up there?&rdquo;
called Peggy, finding her tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to do it,&rdquo; Jo Ann called down,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m caught and can&rsquo;t get down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how did you get up there in the first
place, and why can&rsquo;t you get down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I climbed that scaffold&mdash;it was easy&mdash;but
while I was up here the workmen came, and
now I can&rsquo;t get down. It&rsquo;s hot as the mischief up
here in the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">JO ANN&rsquo;S PREDICAMENT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; called Florence.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sick if you stay up there in the hot
sun all the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see anything else to do till the
workmen leave,&rdquo; answered Jo Ann. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll
get me that parasol, it won&rsquo;t be so bad. There&rsquo;s
a nice breeze, but the sun&rsquo;s terrific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world do you think we can get
the parasol up to you?&rdquo; asked Peggy. &ldquo;Do you
think we can fly up there with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly! Just get my rope&mdash;it&rsquo;s in my trunk&mdash;and
throw one end up to me and tie the parasol
on the other; then I&rsquo;ll pull it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds easy enough,&rdquo; Peggy admitted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run and get it right away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>She was starting away when Florence put in,
&ldquo;Wait a minute; I&rsquo;ll go with you. Felipe might
be at the door, and we mustn&rsquo;t let him see the
rope. It might rouse his curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choke him&mdash;chloroform him!&rdquo; called down
Jo Ann crisply. &ldquo;Anything, only get the parasol,
qu-i-ck. I&rsquo;ll be done to a turn if I stay up here
much longer without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls hurried on to their room. As
soon as Peggy had taken the coil of rope from
the trunk, she slipped it inside the parasol, saying,
&ldquo;This is the way we brought the rope into
the house without Felipe&rsquo;s seeing it, so we can
do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were entering the hall Felipe stopped
them. &ldquo;Have you found Miss Anita?&rdquo; he asked,
using the Spanish word for Jo Ann&rsquo;s second
name, Annette, rather than the longer name of
Josephine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; Florence answered quickly,
hurrying off.</p>
<p>On reaching the balcony Peggy whistled
softly several times, and Jo Ann&rsquo;s head appeared
over the ledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it? Fine! Pitch it up to me,&rdquo; she called
in a loud whisper as Florence put her finger to
her lips and motioned toward the office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>Straightening out the rope, Peggy tossed one
end of it into the air. Up it sailed, then fell
dangling over the balcony rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing I had hold of the other
end,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;This grass rope is so stiff, it
won&rsquo;t go straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would if you&rsquo;d throw it straight,&rdquo; scoffed
Jo Ann. &ldquo;Coil it up again. I believe it&rsquo;ll be easier
to throw that way and pitch it straight up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obeying directions, Peggy tried again, only
to fail once more. Seeing how far Jo Ann was
leaning over the wall in her effort to catch the
rope, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, Jo, don&rsquo;t lean over so
far! You make me nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it looks as if I&rsquo;ll have to hang by my
feet to catch anything you throw. If you just
knew how hot it was up here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fuss! I&rsquo;ll try again, but this balcony is
so narrow that I can&rsquo;t swing my arm. Now,
ready? Here goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up sailed the coil of rope, straight into Jo
Ann&rsquo;s outstretched hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! It&rsquo;s a good thing I didn&rsquo;t miss again,&rdquo;
gasped Peggy. &ldquo;That was work, believe me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Quickly she fastened the parasol to the lowered
end of the rope, and Jo Ann drew it up over
the edge of the roof.</p>
<p>Perched on the wall of the roof, high above
the city, her feet dangling and the parasol over
her head, Jo Ann presented a queer, almost
ridiculous appearance, but to Florence and
Peggy her position seemed anything but amusing.</p>
<p>So dangerous did it look that Peggy cried out
in alarm, &ldquo;Jo! For goodness&rsquo; sake get off that
wall! Haven&rsquo;t you got into enough trouble for
one day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this would be great,&rdquo; Jo Ann called back,
&ldquo;if the wall weren&rsquo;t so hot. There&rsquo;s a gorgeous
view and a delightful breeze&mdash;what more could
you ask for?&rdquo; She drifted gaily into one of the
popular songs of the day.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Just picture a penthouse, &rsquo;way up in the sky,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>With hinges on chimneys, for clouds to go by.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How can you joke about anything so serious?&rdquo;
asked Florence in a troubled voice. &ldquo;Oh,
here comes Dad with a patient! We&rsquo;ll have to
leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the signal as soon as we come
back,&rdquo; Peggy called softly.</p>
<p>Since the office opened with full-length,
double doors directly onto the balcony, making
it almost a part of the room, they hurried toward
the door. Before they reached it, however, they
met Dr. Blackwell and a tall, dignified man,
who, with true Mexican courtesy, bowed politely
and begged their pardon for having disturbed
them.</p>
<p>As soon as the two girls were inside the bedroom,
Florence asked anxiously, &ldquo;What are we
going to do about Jo Ann? I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll be
sick if she stays up there much longer in that hot
sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, too,&rdquo; Peggy replied, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know
what on earth we can do. Isn&rsquo;t there any other
possible way except the scaffold that she can get
down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence shook her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>Every few minutes they stopped talking long
enough to peep out to see if the coast were clear.
After what seemed a long time to them, they
heard voices in the hall, and to their relief they
saw Dr. Blackwell and his patient disappear
down the stairs. In a few minutes Felipe followed
with the bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except for Juana we have the house to ourselves
now,&rdquo; Florence remarked as they hurried
into the office.</p>
<p>On reaching the balcony Peggy gave the signal
to Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d never come back,&rdquo; Jo Ann
called down softly almost before the sound had
died away. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m dying to tell you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to whisper now,&rdquo; Florence
put in. &ldquo;Dad and Felipe have gone out, and we
can stay here and talk to you without fear of interruption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Luck seems to be with me at last,&rdquo; replied
Jo Ann. &ldquo;While I&rsquo;ve been up here alone,
I&rsquo;ve done some serious thinking, and I have a
wonderful plan worked out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time you did some serious thinking,&rdquo;
returned Peggy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I got in this mess, but if you can
only get me the things I need, I&rsquo;ll be standing
down there beside you in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy grinned up at her. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a sheet for a
parachute, I won&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly! I want an iron bar and a hammer, or
something heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to drop them on the workmen,
are you?&rdquo; queried Florence with a half
smile.</p>
<p>Jo Ann laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really quite harmless,
but while I was climbing up here I noticed that
the scaffold was held in an upright position by
pegs driven into the wall, and that gave me an
idea. Why can&rsquo;t I drive a peg into this wall and
fasten the rope to it, and then let myself down to
the balcony? Doesn&rsquo;t that sound simple?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;yes&mdash;it does,&rdquo; Peggy admitted slowly.
&ldquo;But where&rsquo;ll we find the iron bar and something
heavy enough to drive it with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ought to be a hammer around here
somewhere,&rdquo; Florence put in quickly. &ldquo;Come on,
and we&rsquo;ll see if we can find it and the iron bar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t find an iron bar,&rdquo; called Jo Ann,
&ldquo;maybe I could use an old broom handle, if
you&rsquo;d make a point on one end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; they called as they disappeared
into the room.</p>
<p>Entering the kitchen, they found Juana huddled
in a chair by the fireplace, asleep.</p>
<p>Slipping by her, Florence took a small hammer
out of a cupboard, and handed it to Peggy,
saying in a low voice, &ldquo;Now, if we can find an
iron bar, we&rsquo;ll be fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy smiled and whispered, &ldquo;Why, Florence,
this is only a little tack hammer. You
couldn&rsquo;t drive anything into a stone wall with
this&mdash;not in a thousand years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s the only one we have,&rdquo; Florence
answered in a troubled voice. &ldquo;You see,
since we can&rsquo;t use nails in this house, we seldom
have any use for a hammer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy began staring around. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look and
see what I can find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; warned Florence. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not wake Juana
if we can help it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Together they slipped quietly about the room,
picking up first one object and then another, only
to lay it down again in disgust.</p>
<p>At the very moment that Peggy spied something
that would do, Juana opened her eyes and
asked in Spanish, &ldquo;What is it, Florencita? Do
you wish me to make you the <i>merienda</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;no, we don&rsquo;t care for anything to eat
now,&rdquo; Florence replied slowly. &ldquo;But we would
like to have something to drink. Please go down
to the drugstore and get some limeades.&rdquo; She
turned to Peggy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ordered limeades. I know
Jo&rsquo;d like to have a cold drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minute Juana disappeared through the
door, Peggy stepped over to the middle section
of the fireplace. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the very thing,&rdquo; she said,
picking up one of the stones Juana used to set
her earthen griddle on when cooking on the fireplace.
&ldquo;And look here,&rdquo; she added excitedly,
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a piece of iron&mdash;the very thing we need.
Now let&rsquo;s hurry. I know Jo&rsquo;s tired waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How silly of me not to think of these things!&rdquo;
exclaimed Florence. &ldquo;Juana uses that piece of
iron to poke her fire with. Let&rsquo;s hope she doesn&rsquo;t
decide to make <i>tortillas</i> any time soon, or she&rsquo;ll
miss the stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they rushed out into the hall, then
stopped on catching a glimpse of Felipe at his
post just outside the office door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world is he doing back?&rdquo; whispered
Peggy as she stopped. &ldquo;Is Dr. Blackwell
in his office, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slipping into the dining room, they stared
blankly at each other. How could they get the
things to Jo Ann now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what we can do!&rdquo; exclaimed Florence,
running to the china closet. &ldquo;Put the stone
on this plate.&rdquo; She placed a plate on the table.
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll spread a napkin over it; then it&rsquo;ll
look as if you&rsquo;re carrying a plate of sandwiches
out on the balcony. I&rsquo;ll hide the piece of iron
under my dress, like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; approved Peggy, her lips curving into
a wide smile.</p>
<p>On entering the hall Felipe appeared and explained
that <i>el doctor</i> had sent him back to take
the young ladies for a drive, as he would not need
the car for one or two hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask the girls and let you know,&rdquo; Peggy
replied in Spanish, and added, &ldquo;Call me when
Juana brings the limeades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy hastened onto the balcony and, resting
the plate on the rail, whistled twice. As Jo
peeped down from above, she called up gaily,
her eyes twinkling, &ldquo;Just see the plate of sandwiches
I&rsquo;ve brought you. Aren&rsquo;t you hungry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes, I could enjoy a sandwich,&rdquo; Jo
Ann replied, trying to cover her disappointment,
&ldquo;but didn&rsquo;t you get any of the other things
I asked for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all we could find.&rdquo; Laughing mischievously,
Peggy lifted the napkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Peg, you big tease!&rdquo; Jo Ann exclaimed.
&ldquo;I might have known you were up to some mischief.
Didn&rsquo;t you bring the piece of iron or a
broomstick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; called Florence, slipping the
piece of iron out and holding it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing&mdash;but why all the
secrecy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Felipe was at the door, so I thought
we&rsquo;d better use this camouflage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see. I&rsquo;ll let my rope down now; but how in
the world are you going to fasten the rock to it,
Peggy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Peggy replied thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Even if I tie the rope around it a couple of
times, it&rsquo;s likely to fall out, and a stone as large
as this is heavy enough to kill anyone if it should
hit him on the head.&rdquo; She gave a little sudden
start. &ldquo;I know what to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spreading the napkin on the floor and placing
the stone in the exact center, she picked up the
opposite corners of the napkin and tied a tight
square knot; then tied another one with the other
corners. When she had slipped the rope under
both securely, she heard Felipe coming in the
office door.</p>
<p>She sprang to her feet while Florence ran into
the office to keep him from coming onto the balcony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the limeades, Felipe,&rdquo; she told him,
taking the tray he was carrying.</p>
<p>Instead of leaving immediately he lingered a
moment to ask how long it would be before they
would be ready to go for a drive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>For a few seconds she hesitated, then replied,
&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;ll be ready in about half an hour.&rdquo;
Jo Ann had seemed so sure she could get down,
but maybe&mdash;&mdash; &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re not ready by that
time, I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he had left the office Florence
hastened back to the balcony. By that time Jo
Ann had successfully pulled the stone up to the
roof and had lowered the rope for the iron
bar.</p>
<p>The moment she had the piece of iron in her
hands, she hopped off the low wall and eagerly
set to work. Kneeling on the flat surface of the
roof, she held the iron bar firmly against the inside
of the wall with her left hand and struck it
a heavy blow with the stone.</p>
<p>The next instant the iron bar sprang back,
knocking the stone out of her hand and striking
her foot a glancing blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;my foot!&rdquo; she cried in muffled tones,
hopping around the roof on the other foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop for a little thing like this,&rdquo; she
decided shortly, setting resolutely to work again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Less confident of her success, she struck the
iron lightly and carefully this time, but without
making the slightest impress in the wall. Driving
a peg into a stone wall was not the simple
thing she had imagined it to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it can be done, and I&rsquo;m going to do
it,&rdquo; she told herself determinedly. &ldquo;If I can only
find the seam between the stones, I know I can
drive it into the mortar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After slowly chipping the plaster away over a
foot or more in diameter, she found an upright
seam. Her arms ached from the unusual strain;
her hands and face were covered with grime and
plaster dust; and perspiration trickled down her
face, streaking it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she worked on persistently and
at last found the cross-seam. Eagerly placing the
bar in position, she began driving it into the mortar
between the stones. She struck it very carefully
at first, then harder and harder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder these houses last forever,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;I never saw anything so hard in my
life. This one&rsquo;ll stand here several centuries
more and not show the least signs of wear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>With a last effort she struck the iron several
more blows; then, putting her whole weight on
it to test its strength, she heaved a sigh of relief.
It did not budge a particle. Fastening the rope
securely, she threw the end over the wall. Everything
was ready now.</p>
<p>While waiting for Florence and Peggy to return
with the implements, she had tied several
knots in the rope and made two loops near the
upper end, and now, lying flat, she peered over
the edge of the wall to see if the loops came in
exactly the right place, just over the edge of the
roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set! Here I come!&rdquo; she called joyously
to the girls waiting below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jo, do be careful! You might fall,&rdquo; urged
Florence.</p>
<p>So intent was Jo Ann in getting over the edge
of the roof that she paid no attention to Florence&rsquo;s
warning. Climbing over a wall two feet
or more thick was quite a different proposition
from getting over a board fence. She could not
back off, and the smooth plaster offered a poor
fingerhold while she was catching the loops in
the rope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Finally, sitting on the edge of the wall, she
leaned forward and reached for the upper loop.
Grasping the loop firmly with one hand and
pressing the fingers of her other hand against the
plaster, she stretched her foot toward the other
loop. But when within an inch or two of it, she
suddenly slipped off the wall.</p>
<p>She gasped in terror. Down she dropped. Her
arm felt as if it surely would be pulled from its
socket as the entire weight of her body jerked on
it. Could she hang with one hand? What if the
sudden jerk should pull the rope loose from the
peg? Desperately she clung to the loop. Then,
regaining her balance, she wrapped her legs
around the rope. Slowly, carefully she slipped from knot to knot.
<a href="#front" id="rfront">Four strong young arms caught her before her feet touched the floor of the balcony.</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jo! Jo! I thought you&rsquo;d be killed, sure,&rdquo;
cried Florence, tears streaming down her cheeks.
&ldquo;I was so frightened!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was so scared I shut my eyes tight to keep
from seeing you killed,&rdquo; added Peggy tremulously.
&ldquo;I hope that taught you a lesson and
you&rsquo;ll be satisfied to stay where you belong after
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls, look at the spectators!&rdquo; exclaimed
Florence the next moment.</p>
<p>In the street, about thirty feet below, several
peons had stopped to watch this unusual performance,
while others were running to see what
was going on.</p>
<p>After one hasty glance below Jo Ann fled into
the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you do anything here without an audience?&rdquo;
she asked a moment later in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not anything like that,&rdquo; replied Florence. &ldquo;I
do hope they leave before Felipe sees them, or
he&rsquo;ll have the whole story in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m down here.&rdquo; Jo Ann
drew a sigh of relief. &ldquo;I hope I never have to
stay so long in such a hot place again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">THE PROMENADE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Jo, you&rsquo;re hurt!&rdquo; cried Florence. &ldquo;Look at the
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I just left
a little skin up there on the wall when I slipped,
but it isn&rsquo;t enough to worry about.&rdquo; She stopped
abruptly, then added, &ldquo;Oh dear! I was in such a
hurry to get down, I forgot and left your parasol
up on the roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let it stay there,&rdquo; put in Florence
quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather lose the old parasol than
have you climb up there again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am going up there again,&rdquo; announced
Jo Ann emphatically. &ldquo;If I can climb down the
rope, there&rsquo;s no reason why I can&rsquo;t climb back
up, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-o&mdash;I suppose not,&rdquo; admitted Florence
hesitatingly. &ldquo;But Jo&mdash;you might get hurt&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I know exactly how to fix that rope
now so it won&rsquo;t be so hard to get off the roof
next time. I&rsquo;ll pick a time of day when we won&rsquo;t
have so many spectators, for your sake, Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy handed Jo Ann a glass of limeade, saying,
&ldquo;Drink this and stop talking about that next
time. I&rsquo;m afraid most of the ice has melted, but
it&rsquo;ll be cool and refreshing, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann reached over for the glass. &ldquo;Nothing
could be more appreciated right now, though
I&rsquo;m &rsquo;most too dirty to drink it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a sight, all right,&rdquo; laughed Peggy.
&ldquo;Soot&mdash;blood&mdash;dirt&mdash;all over your face and
arms. We can scarcely tell what color you are.
You look more like an Indian in full war paint
than anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all my war paint, I&rsquo;m really quite harmless.
I&rsquo;ve had enough excitement for one day.&rdquo;
Jo Ann sipped the cooling drink. &ldquo;My, this
tastes good! Driving that iron into the wall was
harder work than I expected. I can easily understand
why these houses are so old. Nothing short
of an earthquake or a bomb could destroy them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll take the glass if you&rsquo;ve finished,&rdquo;
said Florence, placing it on the tray. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send
Felipe down to the drugstore with these things,
and that&rsquo;ll give you a chance to slip to your room
and get a bath and change your clothes. We&rsquo;d
better not let anyone see you like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Florence!&rdquo; laughed Jo Ann as Florence
carried the tray to the door and gave it to
Felipe. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she have a time trying to keep
me from disgracing the family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a problem sometimes,&rdquo; agreed
Peggy. &ldquo;Especially when you get your head set
on a thing. You seem to forget everything else
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard what you said just now,&rdquo; interrupted
Florence coming over and putting her arm
around Jo Ann as they started for their room.
&ldquo;I know you sometimes think I&rsquo;m fussy, but
there&rsquo;re some queer customs here that we must
recognize. You know the old saying: &lsquo;When in
Rome do as the Romans do.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Having reached their room, Peggy and Florence
hastened to bring Jo Ann the necessary
toilet articles for removing all traces of her escapade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Jo, you&rsquo;d better use this cleansing
cream first,&rdquo; said Peggy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get all
that grime off without it. Wait, I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo;
she added, rubbing some of the cream on her
neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch! Be careful! You&rsquo;re rubbing the skin
off,&rdquo; cried Jo Ann, dodging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m not! I&rsquo;m being just as careful as
can be. You&rsquo;re sunburned, that&rsquo;s the trouble&mdash;you&rsquo;re
red as a beet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re blistered!&rdquo; added Florence. &ldquo;Just
look at your arms and face now that we&rsquo;ve got
some of the dirt off! I was afraid of that when
you had to stay up there so long. You don&rsquo;t know
the penetrating qualities of a tropical sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you look worse with the dirt off
than you did with it on,&rdquo; laughed Peggy. &ldquo;What
are we going to do with her, Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence shook her head dubiously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know. If Daddy sees her like this we&rsquo;ll have to
explain what&rsquo;s happened, and I don&rsquo;t want to
do that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want you to, either,&rdquo; Jo Ann put
in quickly. &ldquo;I want to surprise him by solving
the mystery of that window. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to
think there&rsquo;s anything strange about it&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t
even look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must promise to be very careful, whatever
you do,&rdquo; Florence warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I just tell you, Jo, that sometimes
you&rsquo;re quite a problem?&rdquo; added Peggy teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just wait till I&rsquo;ve had my bath,&rdquo; Jo Ann
replied as she started out of the room. &ldquo;When I
finish dressing, I&rsquo;ll look all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she returned a little later and preened
herself triumphantly before them, Peggy burst
into a peal of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looks exactly as if she&rsquo;d stuck her head
in the flour barrel and the flour had stuck in
spots, doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; she remarked to Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, her skin does look queer&mdash;a little like
parchment or canvas,&rdquo; reluctantly admitted the
more polite Florence.</p>
<p>Jo Ann grimaced. &ldquo;I like that&mdash;after all my
efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me fix your face,&rdquo; offered Peggy. &ldquo;I
promise to touch your face as lightly as a butterfly
touches a flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the poet!&rdquo; scoffed Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poet and artist,&rdquo; added Peggy, smiling
widely. &ldquo;Watch how skillfully this artist works
on her canvas now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lightly brushing most of the powder off Jo
Ann&rsquo;s face, she applied a generous amount of
vanishing cream, then dusted it with just the
right amount of powder so that enough of the
red in her cheeks would show through to look
natural.</p>
<p>When she had finished, she waved her powder
puff with a flourish. &ldquo;Behold the transformation
from Indian to a member of the white
race!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t look bad at all now, Jo
Ann,&rdquo; smiled Florence. &ldquo;If you stay out of the
bright light, I don&rsquo;t believe anyone&mdash;not even
Daddy&mdash;will notice how sunburned you are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the best you can say&mdash;to tell me I
won&rsquo;t look bad if I stay in the dark?&rdquo; put in Jo
Ann. &ldquo;How&rsquo;re you going to manage to keep me
in the dark? If I stay in my room and don&rsquo;t go
to dinner tonight, your father&rsquo;ll be sure to dose
me with pills and tonics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use candles on the dinner table tonight&mdash;I
often do&mdash;and in their soft light your sunburn
won&rsquo;t be noticeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Jo Ann&rsquo;s vast relief Dr. Blackwell did not
make any comment about her complexion at dinner,
even though Peggy teasingly hinted that she
had taken unusual pains with her toilet this evening.</p>
<p>Unconscious of anything amiss, Dr. Blackwell
asked pleasantly, &ldquo;Are you girls going over
to the Plaza tonight to join in the promenade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can hardly wait,&rdquo; replied Peggy.
&ldquo;Florence told us about the promenade yesterday
while we were driving around the Plaza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Blackwell exchanged glances with Florence,
his eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;that if you want
to catch a suitor, all you have to do is pick out
the young man you prefer, then throw him a rose
as you pass. You can deliver your message by the
color of the rose you use.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;d be lots of fun,&rdquo; replied Peggy laughingly.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll I get the rose, and what color
shall I use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, P-e-gg-y!&rdquo; cried Jo Ann in consternation.
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t really do a thing like that&mdash;would
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I should, I&rsquo;d only be doing in Mexico as
the Mexicans do&mdash;and that&rsquo;s more than you&rsquo;ve
learned to do yet,&rdquo; she finished, smiling teasingly
at Jo Ann.</p>
<p>Jo Ann subsided instantly. A little more, and
Dr. Blackwell might see through Peggy&rsquo;s veiled
remarks and begin asking questions about what
she had been doing.</p>
<p>To her relief Peggy turned to Florence, saying,
&ldquo;Tell me some more about the why and
wherefore of the rose-throwing custom&rdquo;&mdash;her
eyes sparkled&mdash;&ldquo;so I can introduce it in the
States for Jo&rsquo;s benefit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>Smilingly Florence explained that this was a
very old custom but was seldom used now. &ldquo;The
Spanish girls and their <i>caballeros</i> have very few
opportunities of meeting each other. When they
pass on the promenade&mdash;you remember I told
you how the girls all walk in one direction and
the men in the other&mdash;they take advantage of
this chance to say a few words or deliver a message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve finished dinner, let&rsquo;s sit out on the
balcony a while with Dad before we go down to
the Plaza. We can listen to the music and watch
the crowds from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Plaza, which only a short time before had
been almost deserted, began to present a festive
appearance now. Clusters of electric lights
shone, making it bright as day; lines of cars
passed back and forth; and crowds thronged the
broad promenade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>To Jo Ann it seemed as if the balcony were a
box at the theater, and from it she was watching
a play being enacted on an immense stage. The
beautiful, exquisitely dressed girls, who arm in
arm were slowly and gracefully strolling along
on the outside of the promenade, were the actresses
of the play; the <i>caballeros</i>, handsome and
well groomed, passing on the inside and never
losing an opportunity to bow and smile at the
<i>se&ntilde;oritas</i> as they passed, were the actors; as for
the background, there were the trees and shrubbery,
and the benches filled with chaperons. All
the time, the music, soft and rhythmical, was
floating up to her&mdash;&ldquo;the orchestra&rdquo; she told herself,
though she knew it was the notes of the wind
instruments of the band that she was hearing.</p>
<p>Peggy broke into her thoughts just then with,
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we go down there now? I&rsquo;ve never seen
anything quite like this before. I love it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is fascinating,&rdquo; put in Jo Ann, &ldquo;but we can
really see better from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know, but you miss half the fun up
here,&rdquo; Peggy replied quickly. &ldquo;I want to promenade,
too&mdash;be a part of the gaiety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll go now,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;Do
you mind, Daddy, if we leave you?&rdquo; she asked
solicitously as she stooped to kiss his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, my Florencita,&rdquo; he replied,
pinching her cheek affectionately. &ldquo;Run along
now and have a good time. Don&rsquo;t forget, Miss
Peggy, what I told you about catching a suitor,&rdquo;
he teased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Doctor, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she laughed,
&ldquo;and if I do anything to disgrace Florence, it&rsquo;ll
be all your fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the consequences,&rdquo; he returned
lightly.</p>
<p>The three girls ran to their room a moment to
add the finishing touches to their toilet, and for
once Peggy was ready as soon as Jo Ann. All excitement,
she caught Florence and Jo Ann by the
arms to hurry them along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-h, Peg&mdash;don&rsquo;t! My arm&rsquo;s sore!&rdquo; cried Jo
Ann, holding the injured arm away from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; said Peggy sympathetically.
&ldquo;Your camouflage is so good I&rsquo;d forgotten
about your blisters. I&rsquo;ll remember hereafter, and
we&rsquo;ll walk one on each side of you, so no one&rsquo;ll
bump into you and hurt you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They crossed the street and joined the gay
promenade around the Plaza.</p>
<p>While Peggy was enjoying looking at the
crowds, Jo Ann kept glancing back across the
street at the front of the building in which the
Blackwells had their apartment. Since their entrance
was on the side street she had never before
had an opportunity to examine the front of the
house closely. The lower floor, she saw, was occupied
mostly by different kinds of stores.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Shortly after passing opposite the drugstore
beneath Dr. Blackwell&rsquo;s office, she noticed a
broad-arched doorway about halfway down the
block. As she gazed through this doorway and
into the brightly lighted space beyond, she suddenly
gave a little gasp of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a patio I see through that big
doorway across the street, Florence?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; there&rsquo;s a small patio there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that explains it,&rdquo; Jo Ann went on
eagerly. &ldquo;This afternoon while I was up on the
roof I noticed a queer, oblong walled-in place
right in the center of the building. I didn&rsquo;t pay
much attention to it at the time&mdash;I was so worried
about getting off the roof, but I believe now
that this wall must&rsquo;ve been around the opening
for that patio. I&rsquo;m wondering if that patio wasn&rsquo;t
at one time a part of your house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s eyes opened in surprise. &ldquo;What
makes you think that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, because there wasn&rsquo;t a division wall
between that oblong opening and your part of
the house. If it were originally one big house
with many rooms, that would explain the reason
for the huge kitchen and the immense fireplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds reasonable enough, but why
would they have built such a large house&mdash;a <i>casa
grande</i>, as they say in Spanish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s been&mdash;<i>casa
grande</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there you go again, talking about that
house,&rdquo; put in Peggy. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget it and enjoy
the promenade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I won&rsquo;t say another word about it
now, but as soon as we get back to the house, I&rsquo;m
going to look around and see if I can find something
that will prove that I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hopeless, Jo&mdash;the idea of thinking
about an old house when there&rsquo;s all this lovely
music to listen to, and all these beautiful girls
with their Paris gowns, and the handsome young
men to see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>After they had strolled around the square for
over an hour, Jo Ann remarked a little impatiently,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;ve walked long
enough? I think it&rsquo;s time we were going back to
the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s go back yet!&rdquo; Peggy replied
quickly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stay till the concert&rsquo;s over. That
house&rsquo;ll still be standing there&mdash;patio and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; put in Florence. &ldquo;The
band&rsquo;ll probably only play another piece or two.
You can&rsquo;t do any exploring about the house, anyway,
Jo, till Daddy goes to his room,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>So it was that they did not start homeward
until the band had played the last number and
the crowds were leaving.</p>
<p>After reaching the house the girls talked for
a few moments with Dr. Blackwell, then went
on to their room. It was not long afterward that
Jo Ann&rsquo;s keen ears caught the clanging sound of
metal as Dr. Blackwell bolted the outer door.
She waited impatiently a little longer, then
slipped out into the hall, and silently stood at
the head of the stairway, trying to figure out
how these rooms had been connected with the
patio and the other part of the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that patio is in about the center of
the house,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Then this wall opposite
me would be in a direct line with the
patio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since she could not see distinctly in the dim
rays of the night light, she turned on a brighter
one, and tilting it upward, threw its rays directly
on the wall opposite.</p>
<p>To her disappointment she could see nothing
but the plain surface of the plastered wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This hall must&rsquo;ve been connected in some
way with that patio,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
bound to be something somewhere to show how
it was connected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tilting the light first at one angle and then
another, she gazed at the wall intently, searching
for some sign of a former opening.</p>
<p>All at once she caught a glimpse of the dim,
shadowy outlines of a broad arch.</p>
<p>Tiptoeing to the bedroom door, she called
softly, &ldquo;Girls, come here quickly! I&rsquo;ve found it&mdash;I
knew I was right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly she led Peggy and Florence to the
spot in which she had been standing, and again
tilting the light, pointed to the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see the outlines of an arch over
there?&rdquo; she asked, as she threw the rays of the
light back and forth across the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your imagination&rsquo;s running away with you,
Jo,&rdquo; scoffed Peggy. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a thing but a
blank wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do see something&mdash;a faint shadow,&rdquo; put in
Florence slowly. &ldquo;Why, Jo! I do believe you&rsquo;re
right! There was an arch there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;m right,&rdquo; declared Jo Ann triumphantly.
&ldquo;This arch is the end of a wide hall that
connected this back hall with the patio and the
rest of the house. I believe your father&rsquo;s office
was the dining room. Can&rsquo;t you just imagine a
long banquet table down the center of that huge
room and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would they have such a huge dining
room?&rdquo; Florence asked quickly. &ldquo;What could
the house have been used for?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m going to find out.&rdquo;
Jo Ann&rsquo;s chin took on a determined tilt. &ldquo;Maybe
I can find something in Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez&rsquo;s
books that will help me to solve the problem. I
believe that mysterious window has something
important to do with it&mdash;at least, that&rsquo;s the way
it looks to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh! Not so loud, Jo; you&rsquo;ll wake Daddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quietly the three girls slipped back to their
room to talk far into the night about the unexplained
mysteries of the old house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">THE SE&Ntilde;OR&rsquo;S LIBRARY</span></h2>
<p>In spite of all the ointment and salve Jo Ann
had applied to her face, neck, and arms, she
spent a restless night. By morning some of the
soreness had disappeared, but her appearance
was not much improved. Before venturing out
of her room she carefully put on some make-up
and viewed the effect critically in the mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be able to cover up my sunburn from
the servants, but not from Dr. Blackwell,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;His trained eyes&rsquo;ll be sure to
penetrate my mask in the daylight. Here&rsquo;s hoping
he doesn&rsquo;t eat lunch with us today. Florence
says he&rsquo;s nearly always late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her inward consternation, no sooner had
she stepped into the hall than she saw Dr. Blackwell
coming toward her. Immediately she
slowed her steps. &ldquo;If he comes any closer. I&rsquo;m
sunk&mdash;even if this hall is dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>The next moment Dr. Blackwell called a
cheerful &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; to her and disappeared
into his office.</p>
<p>Jo Ann smiled in relief as she thought whimsically,
&ldquo;A guilty conscience is certainly a bad
companion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As on the previous morning, she and Peggy
went with Florence to market, and, as before,
she made only one purchase. This time it was a
roll of very slender but strong hand-twisted
rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what are you going to do with that
heavy cord?&rdquo; Peggy promptly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use it to conceal that big rope I left hanging
from the roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use a string to conceal a heavy rope?&rdquo; Peggy
asked in amazement. &ldquo;Ah, the magician!&rdquo; she
added mockingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Peg. There&rsquo;s nothing mysterious
about it. I&rsquo;ve got to do something with that
big rope before anyone sees it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Peggy shook her head dubiously. &ldquo;Well, I
hope you know what you&rsquo;re talking about&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t. Here comes Florence&mdash;she must be ready
to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the faithful watchdog following, as
usual. You know, I believe he&rsquo;s getting suspicious.
Several times I&rsquo;ve noticed him looking
at me with the queerest expression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Florence said he never misses a
thing. He&rsquo;s probably wondering what you&rsquo;ve
done to your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On reaching home the girls found breakfast
waiting, but Jo Ann could scarcely eat in her
eagerness to get to the balcony before Felipe
cleaned the office.</p>
<p>While Florence went to the kitchen to discuss
menus with Juana, Jo Ann and Peggy
slipped to the balcony. The rope, they found,
was hanging just as they had left it the day before,
and while not very conspicuous against the
dull gray color of the wall, Jo Ann felt that it
ought to be put completely out of sight. As she
studied the wall, she unwound the roll of heavy
cord she had bought earlier in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look down the street, Peg,&rdquo; she ordered.
&ldquo;Do you see anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, it seems practically deserted right now,&rdquo;
Peggy replied. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to climb part way up that rope
again, and I don&rsquo;t want any spectators,&rdquo; she explained
while fastening the cord to the end of
the rope. &ldquo;If you see anybody coming, let me
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as she began climbing up the rope,
Jo Ann realized how sore her muscles were from
the unusual strain she had put upon them the
day before. Would she be able to make it to the
top? she wondered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to do it,&rdquo; she told
herself the next moment, tightening her lips into
a firm line.</p>
<p>Inch by inch she pulled herself up, slipping
the cord through each of the loops in the rope
as she went. On reaching the roof she found it
extremely difficult to steady herself while passing
the cord through the highest loops, but as
she was determined to pull the rope up as high
as possible, she kept on trying. Having succeeded
at last in getting it through the loop at
the roof&rsquo;s edge, she took the end of the cord between
her teeth and began to slip slowly down
the rope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>When she was a little over halfway, Peggy
suddenly cried, &ldquo;Hurry, Jo! Here come some
people! I believe they see you&mdash;they&rsquo;re looking
this way. Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instinctively Jo Ann turned her head to see
the people. As she did so, her elbow scraped the
rough plastered wall. A sharp pain instantly
shot through her arm, and slightly loosening her
hold on the rope, she slipped rapidly to the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How silly of me to do that!&rdquo; she grumbled,
examining her arm. Her sleeve, she saw, was
torn, and blood was running from a place where
the skin had been scraped off. &ldquo;It looks as if I&rsquo;ll
have to be packed in cotton wool to keep from
getting hurt&mdash;but this is not finishing my work,
and Felipe may come out here any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurriedly she searched for an inconspicuous
place to fasten the end of the cord. Finally noticing
the hand-wrought hinge on the door, she decided
that this offered a good hiding place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>She began at once to wind the cord into a
small tight ball, and as she pulled the end of the
cord, the heavy rope attached to it started to
crawl snakelike up the wall. When at last the
rope hung in several long loops at the edge of
the roof, she fastened the cord to the door hinge
and jammed the ball into the crack above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be all right as long as the door isn&rsquo;t
closed,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and it seldom is&mdash;at least, it
hasn&rsquo;t been closed since we&rsquo;ve been here. It
doesn&rsquo;t show much from here, and it can&rsquo;t be
seen from the inside of the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaning against the balcony rail, she and
Peggy surveyed the wall approvingly. The
string was almost invisible, and the loops of rope
at the top were scarcely noticeable, so high were
they above the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one would ever see that unless they were
looking for it,&rdquo; agreed Peggy. &ldquo;But how&rsquo;re you
going to get it down? Didn&rsquo;t you say you were
going back up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I am, but that&rsquo;s simple enough,&rdquo; Jo
Ann replied. &ldquo;When I loosen the string the rope
is heavy enough to drop down of its own
accord.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Hearing a sudden noise behind them just
then, they started guiltily. There stood Felipe in
the doorway. Immediately Jo Ann wondered
how long he had been there and how much he
had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he couldn&rsquo;t understand what we
were talking about,&rdquo; she said to Peggy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
the perfect watchdog, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smiling now as they realized how nearly they
had come to giving themselves away, they
strolled nonchalantly around the balcony and
entered the room from the farther side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to clean the room?&rdquo; Jo Ann asked,
pointing to the broom and mop.</p>
<p>Felipe grinned and nodded his head, &ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>,
se&ntilde;orita.&rdquo; While not understanding the exact
words, he had understood their meaning.</p>
<p>Could Peggy and Jo Ann have seen him a few
minutes later, they would have been very much
amused and not a little worried. The minute
they were out of sight he stepped out on the balcony
and stood gazing up and down the street,
then turned and searched the balcony, but in
vain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Muy curioso, las Americanas</i> [Very curious,
these Americans],&rdquo; he muttered, shaking his head.</p>
<p>After the injured arm had been bandaged
with Peggy&rsquo;s assistance, the girls wandered to
the back of the house in search of Florence.
Finding her in the kitchen in the middle of baking
a cake, they stayed to help her.</p>
<p>To Jo Ann&rsquo;s relief Dr. Blackwell did not
appear at lunch, but when he came in an hour
later, she happened to be passing through the
hall. On seeing her Dr. Blackwell stopped to
call to her that he had met Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez and
that the Se&ntilde;or had sent a special invitation to
her and the other girls to visit his library that
afternoon. &ldquo;Does that conflict with your plans?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Jo Ann answered quickly, forgetting
all about her sunburned face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
wanted to meet Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez and talk to
him ever since you told me about his library.
Maybe I can find out more about your house
and the old church this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>The moment Dr. Blackwell left she remembered
her previous anxiety about his seeing her
sunburned face. &ldquo;I forgot all about my face,&rdquo;
she smiled to herself. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to Se&ntilde;or
Rodriguez&rsquo;s this afternoon, sunburn or no sunburn.
Surely in such a fine library as his I can
get some information that&rsquo;ll help me find out
more about this house, especially about that
mysterious window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, after the siesta, the girls began getting
ready to go to Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez&rsquo;s, Peggy applied
cream and powder to Jo Ann&rsquo;s face with the
most painstaking care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll start a beauty shop,&rdquo; she declared
as she stood back and gazed approvingly
at Jo Ann&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You actually look pretty
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann grinned. &ldquo;Only a real artist could
have performed that miracle. I don&rsquo;t care much
about the pretty part, though. All I want is to
pass muster under Dr. Blackwell&rsquo;s inspection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will&mdash;don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dressed in fresh dainty frocks, the three girls
were waiting on the balcony when Dr. Blackwell
drove up in the car to take them to Se&ntilde;or
Rodriguez&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>Since Florence had told her about the Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s
beautiful patio, Jo Ann gazed eagerly about
when they entered the cool, spacious corridor of
his house. The mosaic tiles of the floor seemed
to her to reflect all the bright colors of the
flowers in the beds beyond and of the potted
plants clustered about the stone pillars which
supported the graceful arches of the court.</p>
<p>The servant immediately ushered them into
the <i>sala</i> or drawing room, a room of immense
size and well-proportioned lines. Several large
mirrors in heavy, gold-leaf frames, she noted,
filled much of the wall space and gave the room
the appearance of even greater size. The full-length
double windows next caught and held
her attention, curtained as they were with exquisite
hand-made lace, which contrasted
strangely with the iron bars.</p>
<p>The next moment their host and his wife entered:
Se&ntilde;ora Rodriguez, short, plump, and
motherly, and the Se&ntilde;or, tall and distinguished-looking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>At first glance Jo Ann&rsquo;s hopes sank. How
could she ask this austere, dignified gentleman
all of the questions which had been uppermost
in her mind? Was the visit she had looked forward
to with so much pleasure going to be in
vain? Since the introductions were in Spanish,
she felt a little ill at ease&mdash;all the more so when
she saw Se&ntilde;ora Rodriguez kiss Florence, first
on one cheek, then on the other, and pat her on
the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she kisses and pats me that enthusiastically
on my sunburned skin, I&rsquo;ll be sure to flinch,&rdquo; she
told herself.</p>
<p>The next moment Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez turned to
her and, smiling, asked in broken English, &ldquo;Are
you de young lady who speak de Spanish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, se&ntilde;or, I can&rsquo;t speak Spanish,&rdquo; she
answered timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>El doctor</i> say you have study de Spanish,&rdquo; he
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, se&ntilde;or, I studied Spanish two years,&rdquo; she
replied, &ldquo;but I speak very little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear young lady,&rdquo; he said pleasantly,
&ldquo;if you do not try, how can you learn? You must
speak to me in de Spanish. You see, my Ingles
ver&rsquo; bad. I am too old to learn de Ingles now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; quickly replied Jo Ann. &ldquo;You
speak very good English. Much better English
than I do Spanish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gracias</i>, se&ntilde;orita,&rdquo; he replied, smiling. &ldquo;But
how can I know?&mdash;you have not speak de Spanish.
My son, Joaquin, speak de Ingles perfect-ly.
I send him to college in de States. You know&mdash;Harvard&mdash;I
t&rsquo;ink you call it?&rdquo; he asked, pronouncing
it Arvard, since the h is always silent
in Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed! I know Harvard. It is a college
of very high standing. Does he like it
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, he likes it ver&rsquo; much. Dis year he finis,
den he come home, and I take him in de office
wid me. If he vas here now he could help you.
De doctor say you are interes&rsquo; in de history of
my city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, se&ntilde;or, I am,&rdquo; she answered quickly. &ldquo;I
want to find out all I can about that old church
across the street from Dr. Blackwell&rsquo;s house.
Both it and the house are so old, I feel sure there
must be some very interesting things connected
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I t&rsquo;ink you are right, and I shall be ver&rsquo;
happy to assist you,&rdquo; he offered. &ldquo;We feel proud
to t&rsquo;ink you are interes&rsquo; in our city. Did you not
want some books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see some that contain old records
and accounts of the early history of the city,
about the time that church was built.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you come dis way, please,&rdquo; he said, bowing,
&ldquo;we shall see what we can find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Jo Ann had completely forgotten
the feeling of doubt and awe she had felt at
first. The Se&ntilde;or was a very gracious host and
had not laughed at her strange idea. Eagerly
she followed him across the hall to a room only
slightly smaller than the drawing room. Bookshelves
lined most of the wall space, and a long
table and several chairs were the only furniture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s decidedly a man&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; she thought:
&ldquo;restful&mdash;quiet&mdash;just the kind of a room in
which to study.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Soon she and the Se&ntilde;or were oblivious of
everything. They had something in common&mdash;books&mdash;even
if they were in Spanish. In a
short time they were chatting pleasantly, unconsciously
using a mixture of English and
Spanish. Together they searched old books and
records, laying aside several for her to take
home so that she might study them at her leisure.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Se&ntilde;ora Rodriguez had
taken the other guests to the patio to see her
flowers, and after about half an hour she came
to the library door and called softly to her husband,
&ldquo;Papa, you must not keep the young lady
here so long&mdash;she will get tired.&rdquo; Addressing Jo
Ann she asked, &ldquo;Perhaps you like to see my
flowers, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to,&rdquo; replied Jo Ann, unconscious of
having spoken in Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have the <i>merienda</i> first, then I show you
the flowers,&rdquo; she said, leading Jo Ann to where
the girls and Dr. Blackwell were seated in the
cool pleasant court beside the flower garden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What could be more beautiful and restful?&rdquo;
Jo Ann thought as she gazed across the patio
with its stuccoed wall overhung with flowering
vines, its fountain tossing sparkling sprays of
water into the sunshine, and its roses, jasmine,
and orange blossoms filling the air with their
mingled fragrance.</p>
<p>By this time the servants had noiselessly
brought in the refreshments and placed them on
an exquisitely inlaid tea table. While Se&ntilde;ora
Rodriguez passed rich little cakes and sweet
buns with squares of <i>jalea</i>, a stiff jelly, the servants
served thick black coffee and delicious, rich
chocolate beaten to a froth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jo, isn&rsquo;t this simply gorgeous!&rdquo; sighed Peggy
happily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never enjoyed anything more in
my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann nodded an emphatic assent, adding,
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve never seen such a beautiful patio before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Se&ntilde;ora Rodriguez had proudly shown
Jo Ann her flowers, Dr. Blackwell announced
that he had several calls yet to make and that
they would have to leave. Silently the girls rose
to go. With true Mexican courtesy Se&ntilde;ora Rodriguez
loaded them down with flowers and
kissed each girl on both cheeks, but to Jo Ann&rsquo;s
relief there was no patting on the back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Laden with books and flowers, they drove
home through the soft, tropical twilight, Peggy
and Jo Ann completely charmed by the dignity
and friendliness of the Rodriguez family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never met finer people,&rdquo; declared Jo
Ann enthusiastically to Florence on their way
home. &ldquo;I admit I was a little afraid of the Se&ntilde;or
at first. He was so tall and dignified, but I forgot
all about that when I&rsquo;d talked to him a few
minutes. It&rsquo;s easy to understand why he&rsquo;s such a
good lawyer, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s a very remarkable man,&rdquo; agreed
Florence. &ldquo;I was sure you would enjoy meeting
him and his wife. By the way, Jo, did you get
any information this afternoon that will help
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I found out several things,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;From the old records we found that the city
was founded in 1560. The Se&ntilde;or said that the
old Mexican towns were always built around
the church. That and the Plaza formed the hub
around which the city grew. If that is the case,
then it is possible that the church was built even
earlier than 1560, before the founding of the
city.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that the church is three&mdash;no, four
hundred years old!&rdquo; exclaimed Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and since Florence&rsquo;s house is between
it and the Plaza, it was built at the same time or
before. It seems to be the very center of the hub.
I&rsquo;m more convinced than ever that its history is
in some way connected with that of the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Dr. Blackwell had gone on his calls and
Florence and Peggy were chatting together, Jo
Ann studied the books she had brought home.
Page after page she read, slowly and with much
difficulty, about the Aztecs and the coming of
Cortez; of the growth of the Spanish territory
until it reached from ocean to ocean, and from
Panama to Vancouver Island on the north;
about Hidalgo, Morelos, and General Iturbide;
of rebellions and civil wars. The wars might explain
the reason for these thick walls, she mused.
They always used the church as a place of
refuge. Perhaps this house was used for the same
purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>To her disappointment, however, she could
find no reference to either the house or the
church in the books. She threw down the books
at last, exclaiming, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take me ages to get
much help from these! It&rsquo;s worse than hunting
a needle in a haystack. In Spanish they go all
around the bush before coming to the point, and
while it&rsquo;s beautiful to read, it&rsquo;s difficult to find
what you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, my dear&mdash;calm yourself,&rdquo;
said the astonished Peggy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been talking
for days about these books, and now that you
have them, you go all up in the air. What a
changeable person you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not changeable. I&rsquo;m glad I have the
books, and I&rsquo;m going to study them&mdash;very carefully,
too, but I can&rsquo;t stand this suspense any
longer. I want to find out something definite
about this house <i>right now</i>. I know exactly how
to get the information I want, and I&rsquo;m going to
get it&mdash;maybe tomorrow. I&rsquo;m almost tempted to
do it this very night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; cried Florence,
alarmed by the determined expression on
Jo Ann&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What wild thing are you planning
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">THE SEALED DOOR</span></h2>
<p>The stillness of the night was suddenly shattered
as a booming noise vibrated through the
silent old house. There it was again. Boom!
Boom! It echoed and re-echoed through the
great hall and high-ceilinged rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; whispered Peggy as she
and Jo Ann sprang up in the darkness, wide
awake in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Jo Ann whispered back. &ldquo;It
sounded like shooting. Do you suppose someone&rsquo;s
starting a revolution? You never know
what to expect next down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you shouldn&rsquo;t have read those old
histories last night, Jo,&rdquo; murmured Florence
drowsily, with a hint of amusement in her voice.
&ldquo;You seem to have war on the brain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what in the world was that noise,
then?&rdquo; retorted Jo Ann. &ldquo;I know perfectly well
I did hear something that sounded like a gun
or a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could finish her sentence the booming
noise sounded again in rapid succession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now! I suppose I&rsquo;m imagining things, am
I?&rdquo; she scoffed.</p>
<p>Florence broke into a peal of laughter as she
rose and began hastily putting on her robe and
slippers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really surprised, Jo, that you
could be fooled by anything about this house&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
studied it so thoroughly,&rdquo; she added over
her shoulder as she ran out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do you know about that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Peggy with a quizzical expression on
her face. &ldquo;I fail to see the joke, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I believe&mdash;I&rsquo;m beginning to see it,&rdquo;
replied Jo Ann slowly. &ldquo;That was only someone
knocking on the door downstairs, but I can&rsquo;t
see why Florence had to answer it. I don&rsquo;t believe
Dr. Blackwell would expect her to go
down there alone&mdash;in the middle of the night&mdash;to
answer the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed Peggy,
&ldquo;but why did she rush off like that, then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>A few moments later Florence burst into the
room, still smiling. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve stopped the
revolution,&rdquo; she announced, her eyes twinkling.
&ldquo;I assure you everything is quiet and peaceful,
and you won&rsquo;t be disturbed again. Go back to
sleep. You&rsquo;re perfectly safe now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I sounded silly, but I was half asleep,
and it startled me,&rdquo; Jo Ann explained apologetically.
&ldquo;I know now it was someone knocking on
the door, but why did you have to answer it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it did look funny, the way I rushed
out there alone,&rdquo; Florence replied, &ldquo;but I knew
it was only someone coming for Daddy. I always
go downstairs with him to bolt the door
after he leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To bolt the door!&rdquo; repeated Peggy. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
he use a key? I never heard of the whole family
having to get up in the middle of the night to
escort someone to the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d much rather bolt the door after
him,&rdquo; Florence laughed, &ldquo;than go along to
carry the key for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ridiculous!&rdquo; Peggy retorted. &ldquo;People
usually carry their own keys, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true&mdash;but this is an unusual house,
you must remember. You&rsquo;ve never seen this key,
have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy and Jo Ann shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s solid brass, about that long&rdquo;&mdash;she
held up her hands eight inches apart&mdash;&ldquo;and
weighs a pound or more. In olden days they took
the <i>mozo</i> along just to carry the key&mdash;when it
was necessary to carry it. We&rsquo;ve found that the
key makes a better parlor ornament than anything
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a bozo&mdash;or <i>mozo</i>, or whatever you
call it?&rdquo; asked Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call a manservant,&rdquo; explained
Florence.</p>
<p>Peggy then turned to Jo Ann and remarked
teasingly, &ldquo;The key&mdash;weren&rsquo;t you hunting for a
mysterious key? There you are! Your wish has
been granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disregarding Peggy&rsquo;s remarks, Jo Ann asked
eagerly, &ldquo;Florence, where&rsquo;s that key? I want to
see it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll keep till morning,&rdquo; Florence returned,
snuggling into bed. &ldquo;Come on&mdash;it&rsquo;s &rsquo;most four
o&rsquo;clock, but we can get a nice little nap before
time to get up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me where the key is, and I&rsquo;ll get it,&rdquo;
persisted Jo Ann. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go to sleep for
thinking about it&mdash;not that it&rsquo;ll help me though,
as Peggy suggested. That&rsquo;s not the kind of key
I&rsquo;m looking for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly where it is,&rdquo; replied
Florence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to hunt for it, but if you&rsquo;re
that anxious to see it, we&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With flashlights blinking, the three pajama-clad
figures crept across the hall and into the
parlor, a room that was seldom used. After
searching among several other old relics in a
cabinet, Florence finally unearthed the huge
key, tarnished and black from disuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; she said, handing it to Jo
Ann. &ldquo;You can look at it the rest of the night if
you want to, but I&rsquo;m going to bed. Come on, put
it under your pillow or anywhere you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>She led the way back to their room, and she
and Peggy quickly crawled into bed. But Jo
Ann sat under the light, turning the key over
and over in her hand, musing. &ldquo;What a key!
Who ever heard of a key so large you needed
a servant to carry it&mdash;but how typical of the
time when this house was built. Everything&mdash;the
walls, the windows, the doors&mdash;practically
impenetrable. What a place of refuge in times
of war and strife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn out that light,&rdquo; growled Peggy, startling
Jo Ann out of her reverie. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
dream as well in the dark? We want to go to
sleep, if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to disturb
you,&rdquo; Jo Ann answered, and, turning out the
light, crawled into bed.</p>
<p>It seemed to Jo Ann that she had scarcely
closed her eyes before there was a knock on the
door, and she heard Florence talking to someone.
&ldquo;What is it this time?&rdquo; she thought
drowsily. &ldquo;Such a night&mdash;just one thing after
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned over and dozed off again, but
again a voice broke into her slumbers: &ldquo;Jo, come
on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t they leave her alone&mdash;or was
she dreaming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to get up, Jo,&rdquo; the voice urged.
&ldquo;Hurry! Juana&rsquo;s not coming today, and we&rsquo;ve
got to do the cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forcing one eye open, she saw the room filled
with sunlight, and Florence and Peggy already
almost dressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-oh, I&rsquo;m so sleepy!&rdquo; she mumbled between
yawns. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get up in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you get for keeping us awake
half the night,&rdquo; scolded Peggy. &ldquo;Now hurry up.
We&rsquo;ve got to get breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you say?&rdquo; she asked lazily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Florence, let&rsquo;s pull her out,&rdquo; put in
Peggy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get even with her for last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word Peggy made a grab for
Jo Ann&rsquo;s feet. But Jo Ann was wide awake in
an instant. Like a flash she reached out, and
catching Peggy around the neck, pulled her
down on the bed beside her. Laughing and
shrieking, the tussle continued while Florence
dropped in a chair, convulsed with laughter.
Over and over the two rolled, first this way, then
that, till they finally landed on the floor, panting
for breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;you&rsquo;re awake&mdash;now!&rdquo; gasped Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I dream it or did I hear you say something
about Juana not coming today?&rdquo; Jo Ann
asked when she could get her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to inform you that you were not
dreaming,&rdquo; replied Florence. &ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s not
coming, and if we eat today we&rsquo;ll have to cook.
Her husband&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s child died, and she went
over there till after the funeral. Juana&rsquo;s so good
I hate to say anything when she misses a day now
and then. The Mexicans have such large families,
someone is always dying. That&rsquo;s why black
is almost a uniform with the peon women.
They&rsquo;re always in mourning for someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious! I&rsquo;d hate to wear black all the
time,&rdquo; shuddered Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this won&rsquo;t get breakfast or clean up
the house,&rdquo; said Jo Ann, dressing rapidly.
&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s get busy. This is just the opportunity
I&rsquo;ve been waiting for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why the sudden ambition?&rdquo; inquired Peggy
quizzically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange I have no recollection
of your having demonstrated your talent for
housework before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind cooking,&rdquo; returned Jo Ann.
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about. I&rsquo;ve been
trying to get in that kitchen without Juana there
so I could poke around in all the corners to my
heart&rsquo;s content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; laughed Peggy. &ldquo;While we work,
you search out the mysteries of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls! Girls! Whatever shall I do with
you?&rdquo; put in Florence, laughing. &ldquo;Which would
you rather do?&rdquo; she added as the trio trooped
gaily to the kitchen. &ldquo;Go to market or have
breakfast first? Since Daddy&rsquo;s already had his
breakfast, it makes no difference which we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same to me,&rdquo; replied Peggy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not the least bit hungry, and I&rsquo;d rather enjoy the
walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has to stay here to look after the
house and answer the door,&rdquo; Florence went on.
&ldquo;Since you girls can&rsquo;t very well do the marketing,
I&rsquo;ll go with you, and we&rsquo;ll leave Felipe
here. This will be one morning you won&rsquo;t have
to be bothered with him, Jo.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; cut in Jo Ann. &ldquo;I have a
better plan than that. Let&rsquo;s have breakfast right
now; then, while you and Felipe go to market,
Peg and I&rsquo;ll stay here and wash the dishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you do that!&rdquo; exclaimed Florence
in dismay. &ldquo;And, anyway, what&rsquo;d you do if
someone came to see Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d say <i>en un momento</i> [in a minute]
and sit them down in the office till you got
back,&rdquo; Jo Ann answered lightly. &ldquo;You see, what
I really want is to get rid of the watchdog for a
little while, and that seems to be the only way of
doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;under&mdash;one condition,&rdquo; said Florence
hesitantly. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll promise not to do anything
daring or dangerous in any way, then I&rsquo;ll
let you stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best to keep her straight,&rdquo;
promised Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do have a time with me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
laughed Jo Ann. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise to be good this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>As soon as breakfast was over, Florence
started off to market, with the faithful Felipe
trailing along behind. At last Peggy and Jo Ann
had the house to themselves. They stacked and
carried the dishes to the kitchen, and then Jo
Ann quickly placed her stack on the table and
walked to the door. From there she started
across the room in front of the huge fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;three,&rdquo; she counted, pacing the
distance to the wall across the room, &ldquo;four&mdash;five.&rdquo;
Then, turning, she measured the distance
back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; she mumbled to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world are you doing now?&rdquo;
asked Peggy disgustedly from across the room.
&ldquo;Have you lost your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me. Seventeen&mdash;eighteen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josephine Annette Cutrer, are you going to
help with these dishes?&rdquo; insisted Peggy.</p>
<p>There was no response from Jo Ann. By that
time she had gone out the door and was pacing
the length of the hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Peg! Oh, Peg! Come here quick!&rdquo; she called
excitedly in another moment. &ldquo;I knew I was on
the right track. Look!&rdquo; Again she paced the
length of the hall from the door, back. &ldquo;You
see,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s about eight feet difference
in the distance on this side of the wall
and that in the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Peggy in surprise.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bound to be the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to tell
you. Now, if the wall measures less on this side,
wouldn&rsquo;t you figure there was some reason for
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;yes, I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then! What would you call a space
eight feet deep&mdash;and with a window in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy stared, wide-eyed. &ldquo;Why, Jo! You
mean&mdash;there&rsquo;s a room back there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly! It couldn&rsquo;t be anything else,&rdquo; Jo
Ann replied, taking the shade off the light.
&ldquo;Here, hold this light at this angle so it&rsquo;ll shine
on the middle of this wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that right?&rdquo; asked Peggy, trying to do as
she was told.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, shine it over a little to your left.&rdquo; The
next moment Jo Ann exclaimed in disgust, &ldquo;Oh,
gee! It&rsquo;s so dark in this corner, even that doesn&rsquo;t
do much good. Wish I had a light &rsquo;way back
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute. I&rsquo;ll get my flashlight,&rdquo; called
Peggy, running quickly to her room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, is that better?&rdquo; she asked a moment
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;here, hand me the flashlight.&rdquo; Jo
Ann reached over for the flashlight. &ldquo;Now you
hold the other one. Two lights ought to be better
than one,&rdquo; she added, gazing intently at the wall
from first one angle then another. &ldquo;Peg, am I
seeing things, or is there a shadow across the
wall?&rdquo; she asked a few minutes later, holding
the light close.</p>
<p>Peggy shook her head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put that light down and come here! Now,
look&mdash;right here!&rdquo; Jo Ann pointed, running her
hand across the wall. &ldquo;And over here! I can
feel a sort of dent in the wall. Don&rsquo;t you see
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&mdash;believe&mdash;I do,&rdquo; Peggy answered
slowly, then, &ldquo;Yes, I do see it now. I&rsquo;m sure I
do!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There used to be a narrow door right here!&rdquo;
cried Jo Ann excitedly. &ldquo;I knew it! I knew it!
I told you the key to the mystery lay behind that
window.&rdquo; Grabbing Peggy, she danced her
hilariously around the hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">THROUGH THE MYSTERIOUS WINDOW</span></h2>
<p>Their dance came suddenly to an end when
Peggy exclaimed, &ldquo;Jo, stop! Hush! There&rsquo;s
someone coming up the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you suppose it&rsquo;s Florence? We
haven&rsquo;t washed a dish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whose fault is it, I wonder?&rdquo; Peggy
retorted teasingly.</p>
<p>In a few more moments a decrepit, half-blind
old man, led by a small, wizened-faced boy, appeared
at the head of the stairs.</p>
<p>Jo Ann gave a long sigh. &ldquo;They must be patients
for Dr. Blackwell. I&rsquo;ll have my troubles
now trying to talk to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you ask them what they want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try. Let&rsquo;s see. Ah&mdash;<i>que queres</i> [what do
you want]?&rdquo; she finally managed in Spanish.</p>
<p>The old man mumbled a reply, but Jo Ann
could not understand a single word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want <i>el doctor</i>?&rdquo; she asked again.
Once more the old man mumbled an unintelligible
reply.</p>
<p>Jo Ann turned to Peggy. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out a
thing he says. What&rsquo;d we better do? Take them
into the office and let them wait? Florence always
tries to persuade the patients to wait for
her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say,&rdquo; replied Peggy
doubtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen such pitiful-looking
specimens of humanity in my life. They look
like charity cases to me, but maybe you&rsquo;d better
try to hold them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll try&mdash;if I can make them understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With renewed efforts Jo Ann struggled to
make herself understood, using a mixture of
Spanish and English and gesturing vigorously
with her hands.</p>
<p>Not the slightest change came over the expressionless
faces of the man and boy.</p>
<p>In despair Jo Ann turned again to Peggy.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re hopeless,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I give up.
Let&rsquo;s just leave them standing here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>As soon as she had stopped talking, the boy
took the old man by the hand and led him down
the stairs and into the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I couldn&rsquo;t hold them,&rdquo; sighed Jo
Ann, dropping down on the steps to rest after
her strenuous efforts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; urged Peggy. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s finish the
dishes before Florence gets back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. We&rsquo;ll have to hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the kitchen, they attacked the
dishes energetically, though talking over the discovery
of the hidden room all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you put things away,&rdquo; offered Jo Ann,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sweep, and everything&rsquo;ll be straight in a
jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had almost finished, Florence appeared
in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How smart you&rsquo;ve been!&rdquo; she praised, glancing
around the kitchen approvingly. &ldquo;You
didn&rsquo;t have time to get into mischief, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had time to make a wonderful discovery!&rdquo;
exclaimed Jo Ann quickly. &ldquo;Guess
what we&rsquo;ve found!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;the family skeleton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring Florence&rsquo;s sarcastic remark, Jo Ann
went on rapidly, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found the door to a
mysterious room at the end of the hall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A door! A room!&rdquo; Florence gasped.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With her words tumbling over each other in
her excitement, Jo Ann began explaining the details
of their discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems almost unbelievable that there&rsquo;s a
hidden room in this house,&rdquo; Florence exclaimed,
wide-eyed as she wheeled about to examine the
shadow of the doorway by the flashlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a door there, all right&mdash;I can see it,&rdquo;
she agreed finally. &ldquo;But what&mdash;why do you
imagine anyone sealed it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy shook her head dubiously and replied,
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about that either,&rdquo; put in Jo
Ann, &ldquo;but I do know that the mysterious window
opens into this hidden room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Peggy agreed
quickly. &ldquo;I believe it does.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do, too,&rdquo; added Florence. &ldquo;But what do
you suppose is inside this hidden room? That <i>is</i>
a mystery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be able to explain that before long,&rdquo; declared
Jo Ann. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to look through that
window this very day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jo, do be careful,&rdquo; warned Florence.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Florence could finish her sentence,
Peggy broke in with, &ldquo;If you go, Jo, I&rsquo;m going
up on the roof with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;that suits me. If things work out
right, I&rsquo;m going during the siesta hour. I
slipped past the watchdog once&mdash;surely I can
slip into the office without getting caught&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She stopped suddenly. &ldquo;Mentioning the office
reminds me that two patients came while you
were gone, Florence. I did my best to hold them,
but I didn&rsquo;t succeed&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t make them understand
a word. They looked stupid to me.&rdquo;
She went on to give a vivid description of their
appearance.</p>
<p>Before she had finished, Florence began to
smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the joke?&rdquo; Jo Ann demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t hold them&mdash;they weren&rsquo;t
patients at all,&rdquo; Florence replied, still smiling.
&ldquo;That was just a poor old beggar who comes by
every few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy burst into laughter. &ldquo;That makes Jo&rsquo;s
efforts to hold them all the funnier. I wish you
could have seen her&mdash;she talked with her hands
as much as she did with her mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a true Mexican, then,&rdquo; laughed Florence.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way they do. But this won&rsquo;t
get us anything to eat. We&rsquo;re going to have your
fried chicken today. How does that suit you,
Peg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy nodded approval. &ldquo;Fine! Who says I
don&rsquo;t rate high in this household?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get so conceited,&rdquo; teased Florence. &ldquo;I
just thought that&rsquo;d be the easiest thing to fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joking and laughing over their work, the
morning passed quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>As soon as lunch was over and the girls had
gone to their room for the siesta hour, Jo Ann
pulled a pair of knickers from her trunk and began
putting them on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be much easier to
climb in these, and I won&rsquo;t be nearly as conspicuous,&rdquo;
she remarked to the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;m not going to do as much climbing
as you are, I won&rsquo;t bother about changing,&rdquo; put
in Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peep out the door, Florence,&rdquo; Jo Ann
ordered a moment later, &ldquo;and see where Felipe
is. If he&rsquo;s awake, get him out of the way. We
can&rsquo;t wait any longer&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have to hurry, or
we can&rsquo;t get through before the city wakes from
its siesta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-ell,&rdquo; she agreed hesitantly, walking over
to the door. The next moment she called over
her shoulder, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s awake. I&rsquo;ll have to put him
to work at something.&rdquo; She disappeared into the
hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so excited I can scarcely wait,&rdquo; Jo Ann
went on as she finished dressing. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
need my flashlight. By the time I get in that
narrow opening, there won&rsquo;t be much space left
for the light to filter through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you the rope?&rdquo; asked Peggy. &ldquo;Do you
suppose it&rsquo;ll take you as long to fasten it as it
did before? Gee, I hate to think of that sun!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You forget the parasol&rsquo;s still up there. I&rsquo;ve
got everything I need. Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Florence returned and announced
that she had sent Felipe to sweep the kitchen.</p>
<p>Thus assured that Felipe was out of the way,
the girls slipped quickly to the balcony.</p>
<p>Unfastening the string from the hinge where
they had left it, the rope dropped within reach.
With the flashlight fastened to the back of her
belt, Jo Ann climbed, hand over hand, up to the
roof.</p>
<p>As soon as she had helped Peggy over the
ledge and slipped the rope off the iron bar, the
two girls hurried on across the roof. They did
not want to stay in the sun longer than necessary
or climb back to the balcony before a crowd of
spectators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this view gorgeous!&rdquo; exclaimed Peggy,
running first to one side of the building and then
to the other, to gaze down on the city lying
quietly below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Jo Ann, busily making the necessary
preparations for her hazardous adventure.
&ldquo;Bring me the parasol a minute, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but what in the world are you
going to do with a parasol?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute and you&rsquo;ll see. I&rsquo;ve got to
fasten this rope to the wall by poking it through
this little hole&mdash;left here for a drain I suppose.
You&rsquo;ll notice the roof slopes down this way a
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see, but how&rsquo;ll that fasten it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tie this stick&rdquo;&mdash;Jo Ann held up a
piece of wood&mdash;&ldquo;to the end of the rope, then
push it through the hole.&rdquo; Suiting her words to
action, she began poking it with the parasol.
&ldquo;Climb up on the wall and tell me when it comes
through, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Peggy, scrambling up on the
wall. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s through!&rdquo; she called a moment
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;you see the stick hangs across the
opening, making sort of an anchor for the rope,&rdquo;
Jo Ann explained. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it lucky for me that
hole was in the right place? I&rsquo;d surely hate to
drive another iron bar in this wall. It&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-ew!&rdquo; Peggy gasped as she looked down
over the wall. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so high on this side of the
house, you&rsquo;d break every bone in your body if
you fell on these cobblestones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut out the dramatics, Peg,&rdquo; scolded Jo Ann.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful. Tell me if the loop on the end of
the rope comes just a little below the window,&rdquo;
she added, testing the knots in the rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Everything&rsquo;s ready, then&mdash;ready for
the great adventure&mdash;the solving of the mystery.&rdquo;
The next moment Jo Ann was over the edge of
the wall.</p>
<p>Peggy watched, breathless, till Jo Ann disappeared;
then, throwing herself across the wall
and oblivious of the intense heat of the stones,
she watched anxiously as Jo Ann descended the
sheer side of the building.</p>
<p>With the utmost caution Jo Ann slowly made
her way down the rope. Carefully she lowered
herself from knot to knot. A false move might
be dangerous. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lots more dangerous than I
realized,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>On a level with the window she stopped.
Then, while standing in the loop on the end of
the rope and clinging tightly to it with one hand,
she tried to get a fingerhold in the opening. Unfortunately,
on a wall that was over two feet
thick and perfectly smooth, it was not possible;
moreover, it was exceedingly difficult for her,
while clinging to a rope high in the air, to crawl
into an opening only two feet high and four feet
across. Holding tightly to the rope with both
hands, she finally swung her feet into the window,
but could get no further. In this half-sitting
position her head and shoulders came above the
top of the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think I&rsquo;m in the window and yet can&rsquo;t
look inside!&rdquo; she exclaimed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; called Peggy anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m just too big to get into this hole!&rdquo; she
answered disgustedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come back up here, then. Give up this
foolishness while you&rsquo;re all in one piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Give up when I&rsquo;m this near? I should
say not!&rdquo; Jo Ann&rsquo;s voice was emphatic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>She began wriggling and twisting more determinedly
than ever, and at last, after repeated
efforts, she managed to stretch herself across the
broad ledge, with her feet dangling in the air.
After resting a moment, she worked herself
around till she faced the mysterious room.</p>
<p>Immediately she felt cold air against her face
and caught whiffs of a dank, musty odor.</p>
<p>Her heartbeats quickened as she realized how
near she was to solving the mystery. What secret
lay concealed within these walls?</p>
<p>Unfastening the flashlight from her belt, she
threw its rays around in the darkness. Blank
walls, stained with age, loomed before her. As
nearly as she could judge, this tiny, high-ceilinged
room was only about six by ten feet, and
the window in which she lay, about fifteen feet
from the floor.</p>
<p>The room appeared perfectly bare. Not an
object of any sort was to be seen. For what had
it been used? Since it had at one time been connected
with the rest of the house, there was bound
to have been some reason for its construction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy and Florence&rsquo;ll have the laugh on
me if there&rsquo;s nothing in this room and I&rsquo;ve had
all this work for nothing,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;There
ought to be something to show what it was used
for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Again casting the rays of her light over every
inch of the room, she stopped suddenly on noticing
the curious appearance of the floor. One half
of it was the dull gray color of the cement, and
the other half, black.</p>
<p>Taking the string from her belt, she fastened
it securely to the flashlight and carefully lowered
it down the wall into the room. As the rays shone
directly on the floor, she gasped in surprise. The
black strip was an open shaft!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it there?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;Where
does it lead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy called down just then, &ldquo;Jo! Oh, Jo!
Come on. It&rsquo;s time to go, and I&rsquo;m roasting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann kicked her feet in response. Why
would Peggy interrupt her at such a time?</p>
<p>By twisting and turning the string she was able
to throw the light back and forth along the shaft.
Carefully she examined it. There was some object
at one end of it, she was sure, but in the
dim light she could not distinguish what it was.</p>
<p>Again Peggy&rsquo;s impatient voice floated down
to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, there&rsquo;s Peg calling again,&rdquo; she
groaned. &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to go now, but I&rsquo;m
coming back&mdash;with more light and more rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as she started to wind up the string, it
suddenly slipped through her fingers. Down fell
the flashlight to the floor, then rolled over and
disappeared down the black hole.</p>
<p>As its rays shone on the sides of the shaft, Jo
Ann caught sight of something which made her
gasp in surprise. In her excitement she almost
fell off the ledge in her attempt to get a better
look at this object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! This is a bigger mystery than I ever
dreamed!&rdquo; she ejaculated aloud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">THE HASTILY PLANNED MERIENDA</span></h2>
<p>Thrilled with delight over what she had discovered,
Jo Ann could scarcely wait to share the
secret with Peggy and Florence. Things were
working out to her entire satisfaction at last.</p>
<p>With the utmost caution she eased herself
around on the stone ledge. Nothing must happen
now to prevent the further investigation of this
mysterious room.</p>
<p>As soon as Jo Ann&rsquo;s head appeared outside the
opening, Peggy called eagerly from the roof,
&ldquo;Jo, did you find anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo; she called back. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that
what I came for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jo, don&rsquo;t be so mean. Was there a room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later.&rdquo; Lying flat on her stomach,
Jo Ann reached for the rope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Getting out of the opening, she found, was
much more simple than getting into it. With
little difficulty she pulled herself out of the window
and slowly climbed to the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you discover? Tell me, Jo,&rdquo; pleaded
Peggy. &ldquo;Was it worth the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it when
we get off the roof. Let&rsquo;s hurry down before the
people begin to stir in the streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;m about roasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found a real mystery this time,&rdquo; Jo Ann
added as she pulled the rope up over the edge of
the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say any more, I&rsquo;ll die of curiosity before
we get off this roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll leave you right here, too,&rdquo; Jo Ann
returned lightly. &ldquo;Before that happens, though,
push the rope in that hole a little to loosen it so
I can catch hold of the stick with the parasol.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Obediently Peggy dropped to her knees and
began pushing the rope while Jo Ann reached
for the other end with the hooked handle of the
parasol. After working for several minutes she
managed to get hold of the rope and slip the
stick out of the knot at the end. Peggy easily
pulled the rope through the hole then, and off
they started across the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have this rope fixed back on the bar in a
jiffy now; then we can get off this hot roof,&rdquo; Jo
Ann remarked.</p>
<p>As soon as she had tied the rope on the bar and
tested the knot she added, &ldquo;You first, Peg.
You&rsquo;ve been in the sun longer than I have. Let
me help you. It&rsquo;s a little hard getting over the
wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think I am&mdash;a baby?&rdquo; asked
Peggy with injured dignity. &ldquo;I can do it if you
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; laughed Jo Ann.
&ldquo;When you get down I&rsquo;ll lower the parasol to
you. Be sure to keep a sharp lookout for Dr.
Blackwell and Felipe. I don&rsquo;t dare to let them
see me in these knickers&mdash;they&rsquo;d know I&rsquo;d been
up to something unusual. I&rsquo;m more anxious than
ever now to keep our adventures a secret till we
solve the whole mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Peggy nodded assent as she leaned over the
wall and looked down. The next moment she
exclaimed in surprise, &ldquo;I wonder where Florence
is! I thought she&rsquo;d surely be waiting for us
on the balcony, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She&rsquo;s probably worried frantic&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
been gone so long. Be sure to be as quiet as you
can now till you find out whether anyone&rsquo;s in
the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quietly Peggy slipped over the edge of the
wall and down the rope to the balcony. Tiptoeing
to the door, she peeped into the office. To
her consternation there was Dr. Blackwell dozing
in his chair by the desk.</p>
<p>After waving an excited warning to Jo Ann
she hesitated a moment, debating whether to stay
on the balcony or to slip by Dr. Blackwell and
see if Felipe were asleep in his chair by the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Felipe&rsquo;s still asleep, I&rsquo;ll signal Jo to come
on,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>Softly she crept into the office. When she had
almost reached the hall door, Dr. Blackwell
suddenly gave a little start and looked around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Miss Peggy&mdash;I thought you were
asleep!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t want to sleep this afternoon,&rdquo;
she stammered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I disturbed
you. Do go on and finish your nap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she hastened out of the room she saw Felipe
turn and look at her in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s wondering where I&rsquo;ve been&mdash;how I got
into the office without his seeing me,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;Poor Jo&rsquo;s in bad luck again, with both
Dr. Blackwell and Felipe awake. I knew we
were staying up there too long. I wonder how on
earth Florence and I&rsquo;ll ever manage to get both
the doctor and Felipe away from the office long
enough to give her a chance to get to her room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she was crossing the hall she met Florence
coming from the rear.</p>
<p>The moment they got inside their room Florence
asked anxiously, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jo&mdash;is she all
right? I&rsquo;ve been worried to death over you girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s caught up on the roof again. Your
father&rsquo;s in the office, and she&rsquo;s scared to come
down for fear he&rsquo;ll ask her some embarrassing
questions. Those knickers&rsquo;d give her away. If I
hadn&rsquo;t had on a dress, I&rsquo;d have been caught.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Florence nodded understandingly. &ldquo;I know
he&rsquo;d be shocked if he saw Jo in knickers. Girls
never wear knickers in the city. He&rsquo;d know she&rsquo;d
been up to something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do? We can&rsquo;t let her stay up
there all afternoon. Can&rsquo;t you think of some plan
to get your father and Felipe out of the way a
few minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence wrinkled her brows in a thoughtful
frown. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say. Let&rsquo;s see. The
only thing I can think of is to make some coffee
and invite Dad to our <i>merienda</i> in the dining
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, but what about Felipe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to decide that later. Come on;
we&rsquo;ll fix the coffee, and by the time it&rsquo;s ready
maybe we can think of something for him to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily they prepared coffee and dainty sandwiches,
then went to the office for Dr. Blackwell,
who promptly accepted the invitation to the
<i>merienda</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll join you in the dining room in a minute,&rdquo;
Florence told him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>As soon as Dr. Blackwell had left the office
and Florence had sent Felipe to the drugstore
for some ice cream, Peggy grasped this opportunity
to call Jo Ann. She flew to the balcony
and whistled softly. The moment Jo Ann&rsquo;s head
appeared over the wall she called, &ldquo;The coast&rsquo;s
clear. You&rsquo;ll have to hurry, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann needed no urging to get off the roof.
She literally dropped to the balcony, drew the
rope up and fastened the cord in its accustomed
place, then ran to her room.</p>
<p>In an amazingly short time she emerged looking
cool and fresh in a soft green dress. Meeting
Felipe in the hall with the ice cream, she offered
to carry it to the dining room.</p>
<p>When they were almost through their lunch
Felipe announced that a patient was waiting to
see <i>el doctor</i>.</p>
<p>The moment Dr. Blackwell was out of hearing
Peggy burst out, &ldquo;Jo, tell us quickly, before
anything else happens, what you found in that
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found plenty. There&rsquo;s a bigger mystery than
we ever dreamed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell us&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; insisted Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do hurry, Jo,&rdquo; added Florence. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
wait another instant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll start at the beginning,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied.
&ldquo;When I finally got in that window&mdash;I
had to lie on my stomach to do it&mdash;all I could see
was a small dark room. There was the odor of
decaying wood or something&mdash;it smelled old and
stale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you s&rsquo;pose they could&rsquo;ve used that
room as a sort of dungeon or cell and left people
in there to die?&rdquo; gasped Peggy, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think so&mdash;there wasn&rsquo;t a thing to
suggest that. It was perfectly bare. I thought for
a while you girls had the laugh on me this time.
I hated to admit I&rsquo;d gone on a wild-goose chase.
I was just about ready to turn around and climb
back to the roof when I decided to look again,
and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She paused dramatically.</p>
<p>Both girls waited breathlessly, then Peggy
ejaculated, &ldquo;Go on! Don&rsquo;t keep us in suspense
any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I threw the light over the floor again
and noticed one half of it was black while the
other half was gray. Now what do you suppose
that black strip was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy and Florence shook their heads. &ldquo;How
do we know?&rdquo; said Peggy. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell either, in the dim light. Then
I tied my flashlight on a string and lowered it
down as far as possible. That black strip was&mdash;a&mdash;black&mdash;<i>hole</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything wonderful about that,&rdquo;
scoffed Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you suppose they&rsquo;d have a hole like
that in a house?&rdquo; put in Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I was wondering,&rdquo; said Jo
Ann. &ldquo;When the string slipped out of my hand
and the light fell bumping down the hole,
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could it bump down a hole?&rdquo; broke in
Peggy skeptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it did&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what I got so excited
about.&rdquo; She paused again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut out the dramatics,&rdquo; Peggy ordered impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, young lady, if you don&rsquo;t like the way
I&rsquo;m telling this, I&rsquo;ll stop right here.&rdquo; Jo Ann
smiled teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do go on,&rdquo; begged Florence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then&mdash;as the light bumped over and
over, I saw remnants of a crude ladder or steps
of some sort. There seemed to be some rough
heavy poles&mdash;something on the order of that
scaffold the workmen used&mdash;but it looked as if
there were steps between the poles. I couldn&rsquo;t see
very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could there be pieces of wood left
in there if this house is as old as you said it was?&rdquo;
demanded Peggy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d all be decayed long
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in this climate,&rdquo; put in Florence quickly.
&ldquo;Are the doors of the house decayed? You see the
air in this country is so dry that things do not
deteriorate as they do in the ozone belt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should they have a ladder in such a
place?&rdquo; queried Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use your head, Peg,&rdquo; advised Jo Ann. &ldquo;You
know the door to the hidden room opens right
at the end of this dark hall.&rdquo; She gestured toward
the hall. &ldquo;Think how convenient it&rsquo;d have been
to have a secret passage leading from there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see what you mean!&rdquo; Peggy exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would they want a secret passage
for?&rdquo; asked Florence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;At the time this house was built,&rdquo; replied Jo
Ann, &ldquo;there were rebellions and wars going on
much of the time, and that secret passage may
have been the means of escape, or it may have led
to a hiding place. I can imagine several reasons
why it would have been convenient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose it goes?&rdquo; Peggy asked
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a very good idea about that right now,
but I&rsquo;ll tell you later. I&rsquo;m going down there and
find out.&rdquo; Jo Ann tilted her chin at a determined
angle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">FLORENCE&rsquo;S SURPRISE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Felipe certainly did look funny when you
marched in with this big package in your arms,&rdquo;
laughed Peggy as she and Jo Ann entered their
room. &ldquo;He was probably wondering why you
hadn&rsquo;t taken him along to carry it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I noticed. His eyes were big as saucers,
and he seemed to be trying to bore through the
wrapping paper.&rdquo; Jo Ann smiled complacently
as she removed the paper from the package and
took out a coil of rope twice as long as the one
she had slipped into the house inside the parasol
a few days before. &ldquo;It seems strange, doesn&rsquo;t it,
to have to carry paper to the market with you to
get your package wrapped, as I did this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Peggy nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing you had that
paper in your trunk. How are you going to fix
that rope now that you have it&mdash;make a rope
ladder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m going to make loops in it as I did in
the other piece. This hand-twisted <i>ixtle</i> rope&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the Mexican name for it&mdash;is so wiry that
I&rsquo;d have a time trying to make a ladder out of it.
Florence said the Aztecs made this same kind of
rope before the Spanish came to this country.
It&rsquo;s so stiff we&rsquo;ll have no trouble getting our feet
into the loops, and it&rsquo;ll be almost as easy to climb
as a ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With deft fingers Jo Ann began tying the
loops in the rough fiber rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me you&rsquo;ll have to make lots
of loops so you can climb &rsquo;way down in that
black hole&mdash;or shaft, as you call it,&rdquo; Peggy
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that. I&rsquo;ll have to figure out the depth
of the shaft so I&rsquo;ll be sure to have enough rope
to reach that far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Florence came into the room a few
minutes later, Jo Ann turned to her and asked,
&ldquo;Do you know how high the first floor of this
building is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Florence shook her head. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest
idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll have to figure it out some way. I
can&rsquo;t afford to get &rsquo;way down there in that shaft
and find out I haven&rsquo;t enough rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you talk about what <i>we&rsquo;re</i> going to
do instead of <i>I</i> all the time?&rdquo; put in Peggy. &ldquo;If
you think you&rsquo;re the only one who&rsquo;s going to
explore that shaft, you&rsquo;re badly mistaken&mdash;I&rsquo;m
going too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann half smiled and answered slowly,
&ldquo;Well&mdash;all right&mdash;if you aren&rsquo;t afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid! Why should I be afraid, any more
than you? I can go anywhere you can. I don&rsquo;t go
around hunting for trouble the way you do, but
I don&rsquo;t lose my head when I get in a tight place.
You&rsquo;ll probably need me, at any rate, if you&rsquo;re
going down in that shaft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Jo Ann admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to prove how helpful I can be,&rdquo; went on
Peggy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how to find out the height
of the first floor. Drop enough rope from the
balcony to touch the street, then pull your rope
up and measure it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good headwork,&rdquo; approved Jo Ann, to
Peggy&rsquo;s delight. &ldquo;I&mdash;no, we&mdash;will do that the
first chance we have. Since you were so kind as
to solve that problem, I&rsquo;ll give you a much
harder one to figure out. It&rsquo;s this&mdash;how and to
what are we going to fasten this rope so we can
go down into the shaft? There&rsquo;s nothing in that
room to which we could fasten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy silently considered this puzzle for a few
minutes, then said slowly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer that
right now, but I&rsquo;ll keep on thinking till I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence, who had been unusually quiet up
to now, spoke up encouragingly, &ldquo;Jo&rsquo;s always
managed so far to do what seemed impossible,
and she&rsquo;ll be sure to find a way to fasten the rope,
if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope your prophecy comes true,&rdquo; Jo Ann
said, smiling over at Florence. &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;d
better go out and take a look at the back of the
house before it gets dark and see if I can&rsquo;t figure
out a way right now. I&rsquo;m ready to stop, anyway.
This rough rope has almost blistered my hands.
Don&rsquo;t you girls want to go with me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do for one,&rdquo; Peggy replied quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
tired of the house&mdash;and it&rsquo;s lovely outside now.
There&rsquo;s a gorgeous sunset.&rdquo; She pointed out the
window to the rose and gold clouds floating
across the azure sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all go,&rdquo; agreed Florence.</p>
<p>With one accord the three girls hastened down
the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on out to the Plaza and watch the
sunset a few minutes before we go back of
the house,&rdquo; Peggy urged when they reached the
door.</p>
<p>The girls nodded assent, and arm in arm they
started walking slowly around the square, drinking
in the beauty of the slow tropical sunset as
they went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen a more beautiful sight,&rdquo; declared
Jo Ann as she gazed at the towers of the
ancient cathedral and the rugged mountains
beyond, outlined against the western sky. &ldquo;It
looks as if golden flames were bursting from each
peak and touching everything with gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as she had finished speaking, a dark-robed
figure moved from the arched gateway of the
church and came slowly toward them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the <i>padre</i> coming from the church,
Florence?&rdquo; Jo Ann asked. Nothing, no matter
how beautiful, could keep her mind long from
the one thing which had become an obsession
with her. &ldquo;Maybe he can give us some information
about the church. Let&rsquo;s ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt to try, of course,&rdquo; replied Florence,
&ldquo;but I hardly think it&rsquo;ll do any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They crossed the street and met the <i>padre</i> on
the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Padre Ignacio,&rdquo; said Florence
in Spanish. &ldquo;May we speak with you a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the Mother of Jesus bless you,&rdquo; the
<i>padre</i> replied. As he passed her house several
times a day, he knew Florence, although she did
not belong to his church. &ldquo;It will give me the
greatest of pleasure to be of assistance to the
se&ntilde;oritas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him if he knows anything about the early
history of the church,&rdquo; begged Jo Ann. &ldquo;You
know my Spanish isn&rsquo;t anything to brag about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>After introducing Peggy and Jo Ann, Florence
carefully explained that these American
girls were very much interested in his church on
account of its great age, the type of architecture,
and its connection with the early history of the
city. &ldquo;This se&ntilde;orita,&rdquo; she said, placing her hand
on Jo Ann&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;is studying the history of our
city and is eager to get all the information she
can on the subject, and we would appreciate it
very much if you could tell us anything that will
be of assistance in making this study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>padre</i> listened attentively until Florence
had finished, then shook his head and replied, &ldquo;I
am very sorry, my dear young ladies, that I cannot
help you, but I have been in this part of the
country only a few years&mdash;only since the change
in government, when the priests and teachers of
God were expelled. Ah, <i>Madre de Dios</i>, but that
was bad, very bad!&rdquo; he added sorrowfully, shaking
his head. &ldquo;It pains me greatly not to be able
to help you but, though I feel very much honored
that you are interested in my humble
church, I know nothing about its early history.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We thank you very much, Padre,&rdquo; replied
Florence. &ldquo;We shall come over to visit your
church again. A <i>muy buenas tardes</i> [a very good
afternoon],&rdquo; she added, and Peggy and Jo Ann
echoed, &ldquo;<i>buenas tardes</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Buenas tardes, se&ntilde;oritas.</i>&rdquo; With a bow the
<i>padre</i> continued on his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad we couldn&rsquo;t get any help from him,&rdquo;
Jo Ann remarked after he had passed out of
hearing distance. &ldquo;It certainly is hard to find
out anything about that old church. Let&rsquo;s go now
and look at the back of the house and try to figure
out a way to fasten the rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They crossed the street and stood gazing intently
at the back wall of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if we&rsquo;ll have to tie the rope to the
iron bars of that window in the back room,&rdquo; declared
Jo Ann finally. &ldquo;You see the top of it is
almost on a level with that narrow opening that
we&rsquo;ve been calling the mysterious window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how&rsquo;re you going to get the rope from
that back window to the opening?&rdquo; queried
Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jo thinks she&rsquo;s a fly or a scorpion and can
crawl across the wall,&rdquo; cut in Peggy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Ignoring Peggy&rsquo;s remark, Jo Ann continued,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fasten the rope securely to the iron bars in
that window; then I&rsquo;ll drop down to the opening
as I did before. I believe by sticking my fingers
in the crevices of the rough plaster I can pull
myself across the wall near enough to the window
to catch hold of the rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty high up there,&rdquo; said Florence,
&ldquo;and that looks like a difficult thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those bars are absolutely the only thing to
which it can be fastened,&rdquo; replied Jo Ann. &ldquo;By
standing in the loop on the end of the rope it
won&rsquo;t be as difficult as it looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on; it&rsquo;s almost dark, and we can&rsquo;t stand
here on the street any longer,&rdquo; said Florence.
&ldquo;Dad may be waiting for us to come to dinner,
and he&rsquo;ll be worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! Why can&rsquo;t we explore the mysterious
shaft tonight?&rdquo; Jo Ann exclaimed suddenly.
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take long to tie the rest of the loops
and test the knots. Everything else is ready&mdash;the
flashlights and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight!&rdquo; gasped Florence, whether in consternation
or surprise, Jo Ann could not decide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, tonight. There&rsquo;s a full moon&mdash;it&rsquo;ll be
as bright as day out, and I&rsquo;m afraid if we wait
something&rsquo;ll happen to spoil the whole thing.
I&rsquo;d just die if I didn&rsquo;t get to carry this out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why at night?&rdquo; asked Peggy as they
climbed the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; returned Jo Ann. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
be any darker in that shaft at night than in the
daytime. You couldn&rsquo;t see your hand before your
face down there right in the middle of the day.
We&rsquo;ll carry our flashlights. I got some more
batteries and an extra globe for the one I
dropped. I thought we might need an extra one&mdash;that
is, if that flashlight isn&rsquo;t smashed all to
pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could go too,&rdquo; said Florence tentatively.</p>
<p>Jo Ann and Peggy exchanged swift glances,
but neither offered one word of encouragement
to Florence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Surprised at this request and not knowing how
to answer it, Jo Ann and Peggy were silent as
they sat on the balcony waiting the call to dinner.
Lights like fireflies flashed here and there as
darkness settled over the city, and a slight breeze,
heavy with the scent of orange blossoms, stirred
the trees across the way.</p>
<p>Florence finally broke the silence. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go
with you and Peggy, Jo Ann? I&rsquo;d be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann and Peggy were thankful at that moment
for the darkness. Florence must not see the
look of dismay on their faces. How could they
refuse to let her go with them when it was her
house?&mdash;and yet both felt that they dared not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy, ask her to let me go,&rdquo; Florence begged
when Jo Ann did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence&mdash;you see,&rdquo; began Jo Ann slowly,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be rather dangerous, and your father&rsquo;d
never forgive us if anything should happen to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had lots more experience climbing
than you have,&rdquo; added Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but I can climb that rope,&rdquo; Florence
put in coaxingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Florence, you shouldn&rsquo;t have tried it
alone!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you
tell us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want you to know till I found out
whether I could do it. I&rsquo;ve wanted so much to
do the things you girls do, but I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t
be safe to go down in that shaft without some
practice climbing a rope. I feel sure I can climb
down there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t picture you as a tomboy climbing on
top of the house,&rdquo; put in Peggy, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here I&rsquo;ve been thinking all the time that
you were terribly shocked at our behavior,&rdquo;
added Jo Ann.</p>
<p>Florence shook her head. &ldquo;Not shocked&mdash;just
envious. I&rsquo;ve been practicing going up and down
that rope every morning before you girls were
out of bed. I can do it easily now. You know last
summer at camp I got so I could climb mountains
as well as the rest of the girls, after I&rsquo;d had
a little experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a plucky little rascal,&rdquo; praised Jo
Ann. &ldquo;If she wants to go with us that badly, we&rsquo;ll
have to let her go, won&rsquo;t we, Peggy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy nodded an emphatic assent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">INTO THE UNKNOWN</span></h2>
<p>After they had gone to their room that
night, the girls continued to talk over their plans
for exploring the mysterious black shaft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going to get the benefit of the full
moon, we&rsquo;ll have to go down into the shaft in the
next two or three nights, so we might as well go
down tomorrow night,&rdquo; Jo Ann said earnestly.
&ldquo;What do you say to our going tomorrow night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence and Peggy exchanged excited
glances, then replied in unison, &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning they set to work early to get
everything ready for their great adventure.</p>
<p>So it was that just as the bells in the cathedral
tower finished chiming the midnight hour, three
lithe, knicker-clad figures crept one by one up
on the roof and over near the chimney.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wait a little while,&rdquo; said Jo
Ann, low-voiced. &ldquo;The moon isn&rsquo;t up far enough
yet for it to throw much light on the rear of the
house. I can&rsquo;t get the other coil of rope out of
that back window without more light.&rdquo; She
placed her gloves, flashlight, and rope on the
roof beside her, the other girls following her example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we have to wait,&rdquo; Florence remarked.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely up here in the moonlight.
Wouldn&rsquo;t this be a wonderful place for a roof
garden? We could come up here and enjoy it
every&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; broke in Peggy with her finger to
her lips. &ldquo;I hear music!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obediently Florence and Jo Ann stopped talking
to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>caballero</i> serenading his lady love,&rdquo; Florence
explained in reply to Peggy&rsquo;s questioning
look.</p>
<p>The next moment Peggy began swaying to the
rhythm of the music like a graceful willow tree
in the breeze; then catching Florence by the
arm, she danced her lightly across the roof.</p>
<p>When they neared Jo Ann again, she called
to them softly, &ldquo;Better not make so much noise!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No one&rsquo;d ever dream of looking up here,&rdquo;
Peggy murmured over her shoulder, dancing
away and not stopping till the music ended.</p>
<p>The spell being broken then, the three girls
clambered to the top of the wall and sat there for
several minutes looking down on the city below.
In the brilliant tropical moonlight the winding
gray paths and dark shadowy trees and shrubbery
of the Plaza were silhouetted against the
white-walled buildings beyond. High above all,
like a sentinel on guard over the sleeping city,
rose the bell tower of the cathedral.</p>
<p>They were still gazing at this enchanting,
etching-like picture when the chimes rang out
again.</p>
<p>Jo Ann gave a little start. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize
we&rsquo;d been sitting here so long. This moonlight&rsquo;s
cast a spell over me&mdash;I&rsquo;d almost forgotten what
we came up here for. I&rsquo;m going over now to see
if there&rsquo;s enough light shining on that back wall
for me to get the rope that we fastened to the
iron bars of the window.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>She sprang down lightly and crossed the roof.
One glance showed her that she still had a few
minutes to wait before the rays of the moon
would light the back window. As she stood looking
out over the rear wall of the church, her
gaze traveled on past the adobe huts toward the
river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moonlight has worked magic,&rdquo; she
thought in surprise. &ldquo;It has changed that ugly
district into a thing of beauty; those dirty adobe
huts look white and shining, and that muddy
river, silvery and peaceful. If only something
could transform the lives of the people who live
there the same way! I wish there were something
I could do to help them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook herself slightly. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any
good to stand here dreaming about it,&rdquo; she said
aloud, then turned and called softly to the girls,
&ldquo;Come on. It&rsquo;s light enough now for me to see
to get that rope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>While she had been talking she had fastened
her flashlight to her belt and slipped on a pair of
heavy gloves to protect her hands from the
scratchy fiber rope. That done, she lowered herself
over the wall and slipped down till her feet
reached the loop on the end; then holding the
rope firmly under one arm, she dug her fingers
into the rough plaster and moved slowly across
the wall. When she had almost reached the window,
her hands slipped. Like the pendulum of
a huge clock, she swung back and forth, clinging
tightly to the rope. Simultaneously there was
the sting of fire across her shoulder and arm.
Glancing around, she saw that her shirt was torn
and blood was oozing from her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a little thing like that?&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to bother with it now.&rdquo; Maybe
if she&rsquo;d take off her gloves, she could reach the
window. Jerking them off, she tried again and
again to get a fingerhold in the wall to pull herself
across, but without success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as simple as I thought,&rdquo; she told herself,
wondering what to do next.</p>
<p>Hearing a soft whistle just then, she glanced
up where Peggy and Florence were watching
from the roof. Peggy was gesturing excitedly as
if she were trying to tell her what to do. What
could she mean?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>The next moment she felt the end of the heavy
cord dangling in her face, and immediately she
understood. She grasped the cord and fastened it
securely to the rope to which she was clinging;
then with Peggy and Florence pulling on the
cord from the roof, she found it easy to move
across the wall. There was no danger of slipping
now. Having braced herself with one foot between
the iron bars of the window, she unwound
the coil of rope which she had fastened there
from the inside earlier in the evening. After
testing it to see that the end was securely fastened
to the bars, she whistled softly to the girls. At
once the cord slackened, and she swung slowly
back with the end of the long, knotted rope in
her hand.</p>
<p>On reaching the narrow window she pitched
the rope through, then wriggled herself onto the
ledge. After turning on her stomach she had both
hands free to unfasten her flashlight.</p>
<p>Anxiously then she waited for Florence to
descend. By having her come between them she
and Peggy felt they could look after her better.
But now, to her amazement, she saw that Florence
was fully capable of looking after herself.
She was climbing down slowly and cautiously,
but not timidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Since the narrow window was very small and
would hold only one, Jo Ann knew she must
hurry to get out of it. After a hasty examination
of the room below, she lowered herself to the
floor, careful to avoid falling into the open shaft
which extended completely across one end.</p>
<p>The moment she touched the floor she flashed
the light upward so as to help Florence and
Peggy in their descent. In a few more moments
they were standing safely beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a strange place!&rdquo; Peggy said, then
added quickly in a whisper, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wake Dr.
Blackwell at this rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; talk as loud as you like,&rdquo; replied Jo Ann.
&ldquo;These walls are so thick I believe you could
yell down here without his hearing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls stared at Jo Ann in amazement. It
seemed incredible&mdash;uncanny&mdash;that they could be
within a few feet of home and Dr. Blackwell,
and yet he could not hear them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>With the aid of their flashlights they examined
the room from top to bottom, only to find
that except for the rough outlines of the sealed
doorway, it was bare and uninteresting. Half
fearfully, then, they stared down into the shaft.
In the surrounding darkness the old ladder
looked white and ghostlike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you suppose they sealed up that door
instead of closing up this hole?&rdquo; queried Peggy
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it was much easier to close up the
door,&rdquo; replied Jo Ann. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be hard to conceal
as large an opening as this in a cement floor. I
have an idea that the door was sealed up in a
hurry to prevent the discovery of this secret passage.
Let&rsquo;s see where it leads. Shine your lights
over this way so I can see,&rdquo; she ordered, climbing
over the edge of the floor.</p>
<p>Slowly she made her way down the rope into
the shaft. Now and then she stopped to kick off
a loose step or a jagged splinter from the old
ladder lest it should injure Florence and Peggy,
who would follow in a moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Suddenly she gave a little shriek. There to one
side of the shaft yawned the mouth of a low,
tunnel-like opening. &ldquo;O-oh, hurry, girls!&rdquo; she
cried excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; called Peggy in alarm.
&ldquo;Are you hurt? Be there in a minute,&rdquo; she added
as she started down the rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hurt, but I&rsquo;ve found something important,&rdquo;
Jo Ann called back.</p>
<p>In a surprisingly short time both Peggy and
Florence had dropped down to the bottom of the
shaft beside Jo Ann. With eyes straining to penetrate
the darkness, the girls peered into the tunnel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go inside,&rdquo; urged Jo Ann.
Even as she was speaking, she stooped and
entered the low, narrow tunnel.</p>
<p>Obediently Peggy and Florence followed at
her heels. No sooner had they entered than they
began coughing and choking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Florence stopped in
the middle of her warning to sneeze loudly; at
the same moment such a violent attack of coughing
seized Peggy that she leaned against the
wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lean against&mdash;that wall!&rdquo; gasped Florence,
catching her by the arm. &ldquo;Whenever you
do&rdquo;&mdash;she stopped to sneeze again&mdash;&ldquo;it stirs up a
fine dust. See!&rdquo; she added, rubbing her finger
over the wall. In the rays of the lights they could
see a fine white powder which had formed on
the crumbling stones. &ldquo;The air&rsquo;s very dry,
and the least movement sets the powder in
motion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Careful to avoid touching the walls or making
a sudden motion that would stir up the dust, they
began examining their surroundings. Before
them as far as they could see stretched the dark
passageway, part of its walls having apparently
been cut through natural stone, while the other
part had been lined with blocks of limestone. It
was the dust from these limestone blocks which
had choked them, Florence noticed.</p>
<p>After they had walked a short distance the
opening broadened and was much higher. It was
easy to avoid touching the walls now, and even
Jo Ann could stand without bumping her head.
With Jo Ann still in the lead they walked slowly
in single file down the passage. All along the
way they kept flashing their lights on the walls
and ceiling and floor, watching carefully lest
they overlook something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose we are now, Jo?&rdquo;
called Peggy some minutes later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know for sure, of course, but I think
we&rsquo;re headed toward the old church. I had an
idea we&rsquo;d find something like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; agreed Florence.
&ldquo;This tunnel must&rsquo;ve been used for a secret exit
through the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s more than just an exit,&rdquo; declared
Jo Ann. &ldquo;They would never have made this tunnel
this broad and high or lined it with stone if
it were to be used merely as a way of escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else could it&rsquo;ve been used for, then&mdash;and
who do you suppose ever had it made in the
first place?&rdquo; Florence asked curiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe your house used to be closely connected
with the church in some way&mdash;maybe it
was used as a home for the priests. Back in the
days when these buildings were erected, they
were always having wars and revolutions. This
tunnel would make it possible for the priests to
get over to the church, no matter what was going
on outside. Then just think what an excellent
place this would be to hide anyone or anything!
I believe it was used as a hiding place in war
times as well as an&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped suddenly.
&ldquo;Oh, here&rsquo;s another tunnel!&rdquo; she exclaimed as
she peered into another large opening in the side
of the passageway. &ldquo;And this one goes on farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if there&rsquo;s a network of passages,&rdquo;
put in Peggy excitedly as she and Florence
crowded near Jo Ann to see this discovery. &ldquo;I
wonder where they go and what they were for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll explore them and find out; but we must
be careful not to get lost,&rdquo; cautioned Jo Ann.
&ldquo;No one&rsquo;d ever know what had happened to us.
They&rsquo;d think we&rsquo;d just evaporated in thin air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; shuddered Peggy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even mention
such a thing. It gives me the creeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look, here&rsquo;s a little niche in the wall!&rdquo;
exclaimed Florence. &ldquo;And look&mdash;what is this?&rdquo;
she asked, holding up a queer-shaped piece of
dark metal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like some sort of a candle holder to
me,&rdquo; Peggy volunteered. &ldquo;The priests must have
kept candles there to use when going back and
forth through the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped abruptly
and sprang back, shrieking. Something black and
winged had struck her in the face.</p>
<p>The next moment Florence cried excitedly,
&ldquo;What is that awful thing?&rdquo; She slapped madly
at a passing object, then began to sneeze violently.</p>
<p>For a few moments the air was white with
dust about the girls as they huddled together,
choking and gasping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&mdash;just&mdash;bats!&rdquo; gasped Jo Ann at last,
as the air became clearer. &ldquo;We frightened&mdash;them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;they&mdash;frightened us,&rdquo; corrected
Peggy. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we brave, though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit I was startled at first,&rdquo; acknowledged
Florence. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t imagine what those
horrid flapping things were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before venturing any further they looked anxiously
all around, but to their relief they could
see no more of the terrifying little creatures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which way shall we go?&rdquo; asked Jo Ann.
&ldquo;Straight ahead, or shall we see where this side
tunnel leads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do,&rdquo; suggested Peggy.
&ldquo;While you and Florence explore that side passage,
I&rsquo;ll wait here in this main tunnel. That way
you can&rsquo;t get lost&mdash;and if you get frightened,
just call me, and I&rsquo;ll answer so you&rsquo;ll know how
to get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you won&rsquo;t be afraid?&rdquo; asked Jo
Ann. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be gone long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rdquo; bragged
Peggy. &ldquo;Anyway, there&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of&mdash;except
those miserable bats, and we&rsquo;ve frightened
them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; agreed Jo Ann. &ldquo;You be
sure to stay right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy grinned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;ll
be all right. It&rsquo;s you two who&rsquo;re going into the
unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Standing in the opening where the tunnels
joined, she watched Florence and Jo Ann disappear
into the darkness. Finally only a dim light
flickered in the distance, then vanished altogether.
She was alone&mdash;alone with the dust of
the centuries about her.</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s voice floated back just then with surprising
clearness. &ldquo;Everything all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Peggy called back, more cheerfully
than she felt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">GHOSTLY FIGURES</span></h2>
<p>When Jo Ann and Florence had gone only a
short distance, they noticed the tunnel curved so
that they could not see Peggy&rsquo;s light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Peg&rsquo;s alone now&mdash;she can&rsquo;t even see our
lights,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;I almost wish we hadn&rsquo;t
left her back there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;ll stay right where we left her, she
ought to be all right. But this is the darkest place
I was ever in&mdash;spooky, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked slowly, stopping every now and
then to examine the sides and top of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Jo Ann suddenly pointed to the top. &ldquo;Look up
there! There&rsquo;s a crack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back&mdash;that looks scary to me!&rdquo; Florence
exclaimed quickly. &ldquo;It might cave in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that small a crack couldn&rsquo;t be dangerous.
Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Jo Ann started on again, and reluctantly Florence
followed. In spite of her seeming indifference
to danger, Jo Ann was really examining the
walls and top more cautiously than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another crack!&rdquo; she exclaimed a few
minutes later. &ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s been an earthquake
near here. They do have earthquakes down
here sometimes, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, now and then&mdash;slight ones,&rdquo; Florence
replied. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;d better go back?
Poor Peg may be getting lonesome, and we told
her we wouldn&rsquo;t be gone long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann half smiled. &ldquo;Maybe she is, but let&rsquo;s
go a little farther. Surely we&rsquo;ll come to the end
of this tunnel soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no telling how long it is&mdash;it might
be miles long. Let&rsquo;s go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a minute. I see something ahead&mdash;something
whitish. Maybe it&rsquo;s a little opening and the
moonlight&rsquo;s shining through.&rdquo; Jo Ann stopped
and pointed directly ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do see it!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed. &ldquo;It
does look white.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>Eagerly Jo Ann led the way onward, but not
without watching for anything that might be
dangerous. When they had gone a few yards
farther, she suddenly cried, &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a cave-in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see&mdash;I told you we&rsquo;d better go back.
Come on.&rdquo; Florence turned around and started
toward the entrance. When she had gone only a
few steps she noticed that Jo Ann was not following
her. Looking back, she saw her leaning
over, examining the pile of debris and fallen
stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! The tunnel&rsquo;s almost blocked by this
cave-in!&rdquo; Jo Ann called. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only a small
opening left over here on one side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t go any farther, so let&rsquo;s get out
before it caves in some more,&rdquo; insisted Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s any danger of that.
Look at the dust on these stones. They&rsquo;ve been
here for years and years. Maybe a cannon ball
shattered this part of the tunnel in one of the
wars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, but I&rsquo;ll feel better when we get
away from here.&rdquo; A moment later she cried out
in alarm on seeing Jo Ann climb up toward the
hole. &ldquo;Jo, you mustn&rsquo;t crawl in there!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? I want to see if this is the end of
the tunnel. There isn&rsquo;t any danger. These stones
are solid. See, I&rsquo;ve felt every one of them.&rdquo; Jo
Ann pushed first one stone, then another, to show
that there was no danger of their slipping; then
with her flashlight ahead of her she thrust her
head and shoulders into the opening.</p>
<p>To her disappointment she could see only a
short distance. Eager to see as far as possible, she
wriggled carefully over the jagged stones, farther
into the opening, and held her flashlight at
arm&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is nothing but a little cave-in!&rdquo; she
called back in a muffled tone. &ldquo;The tunnel goes
on a long way. There&rsquo;s no sign of the end of it.
Let&rsquo;s crawl on through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed, I&rsquo;m not going in that hole,&rdquo; Florence
replied promptly. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;d better get out
right a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A muffled shriek from Jo Ann broke into her
sentence. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve dropped my flashlight on the
other side! Now I&rsquo;ve&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped to cough
violently&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to crawl through&mdash;and get
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t crawl clear through&mdash;you might not
be able to get back!&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s voice was full
of anxiety. &ldquo;Let me hold your feet while you
reach for the flashlight.&rdquo; Without waiting for an
answer she grasped Jo Ann&rsquo;s feet firmly.</p>
<p>Slowly then Jo Ann wriggled still farther into
the hole. The farther she crawled, the nearer
Florence was pulled to the opening. With a sudden
jerk Jo Ann reached over to get her flashlight.
In her effort she threw Florence against
the pile of debris and stirred up the fine dust,
which set both of them to coughing and struggling
for air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up&mdash;and&mdash;crawl&mdash;out,&rdquo; begged Florence
between gasps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming&mdash;this instant. Pull me&mdash;back. I&mdash;can&rsquo;t&mdash;make
it&mdash;by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence laid down her flashlight and began
pulling at Jo Ann&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull harder,&rdquo; Jo Ann grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pulling&mdash;as hard as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t budged. Pull again&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll wiggle
as hard as I can. These sharp stones hurt like
fury.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Once more Florence braced herself and
pulled with all her strength. The next moment
one of Jo Ann&rsquo;s oxfords slipped off, and Florence
was sent sprawling backward on the floor. In
the cloud of dust that arose, Florence caught a
glimpse of Jo Ann&rsquo;s feet disappearing in the hole.</p>
<p>But Jo Ann and Florence were not the only
ones who were having their troubles. Peggy, too,
was having her share. No sooner had the girls&rsquo;
lights disappeared than she began to get restless.
Everything looked so much more gloomy and
alarming in the faint glow of one flashlight.
When she threw its rays directly in front, they
penetrated the darkness only a short distance and
cast eerie shadows on the walls near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s silly to get scared of the dark and
shadows this way,&rdquo; she scolded herself.</p>
<p>With an effort she tried to concentrate on the
persons who had built these tunnels. Patient people
they must have been to cut these passages
through solid stone with their old crude tools.
They were probably Indian workmen, experienced
in cutting stone. It must have taken them
years and years to make these.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>All at once it seemed to her that the shadow
on her right took the form of a crouching Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am being silly again,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m standing still here that I&rsquo;m
nervous. It&rsquo;s lonesome as well as scary, staying
still in a spooky place like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking around for something to divert her
mind, she noticed the queer-shaped piece of
metal in the niche and wondered what Florence
had done with the other one. &ldquo;Perhaps she
dropped it when the bats frightened her,&rdquo; she
thought.</p>
<p>She cast the rays of her light over the floor till
she finally found the piece of metal, then placed
it back in the niche with its mate. &ldquo;Jo and I can
use one of these for a candle holder on the little
table beside our bed, and Florence can use the
other,&rdquo; she decided.</p>
<p>Not seeing anything else of interest, she grew
more restless than ever. &ldquo;I wonder where this
tunnel leads. I believe I&rsquo;ll walk down it a little
way. Florence and Jo probably won&rsquo;t be back for
several minutes. There&rsquo;s no sign of their lights
yet. I won&rsquo;t go but a few steps. They might call,
and I couldn&rsquo;t hear them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>She walked slowly a short distance, looking
carefully on all sides. When she had gone about
twelve feet she came to a narrow opening on her
right.</p>
<p>She stopped and peered into it as far as her
light would permit. &ldquo;This place is certainly a
network of passages,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I wonder
what this narrow one&rsquo;s for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her curiosity aroused, she turned into this new
passage and kept straight ahead for a little way.
Then as she flashed her light about, she caught a
glimpse of another opening, to her left. Glancing
into this opening, she saw at the farther end
what appeared to be a door half ajar.</p>
<p>Her eyes began to shine. &ldquo;Surely I&rsquo;ll find
something important behind that door,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be a rich joke on Jo and Florence
if I should be the one to make some great discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>With her heart thumping rapidly she walked
down to the door, peeped in, then cautiously
opened the door wider and stepped inside. To
her great disappointment the room was absolutely
bare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just my luck!&rdquo; she groaned. &ldquo;I thought
surely I was going to find something interesting
to show the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disgusted, she hurried out of the room and
back to the passage, then turned quickly to her
left and hastened on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more turn, and I&rsquo;ll be back in the main
tunnel,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>When she had gone a short distance, she discovered
that the passage apparently ended a few
feet ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this isn&rsquo;t the way I came!&rdquo; she cried in
alarm. Her heart seemed to leap up into her
throat, and her eyes dilated in horror. &ldquo;Why,
I&rsquo;m lost! Lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment she ordered herself sternly,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose your head! Go back and retrace your
steps to that opening. You&rsquo;ve taken the wrong
turn&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a fresh grip on her emotions she wheeled
about and walked to the opening from which she
had just emerged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here&rsquo;s where I made my mistake!&rdquo; she
exclaimed in relief. &ldquo;I turned to the left instead
of the right. What a stupid I was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started on again and kept straight ahead
till she reached the entrance to the main tunnel.</p>
<p>As her light shone on the wall directly in front
of her she suddenly halted in surprise. There, a
little to her right, was a recess in the wall with a
long, solid-looking panel in the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I wonder what
that panel&rsquo;s for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flashed her light straight into the recess
this time. In the circle of light a black metal
ring stood out distinctly. Could this queer-looking
panel be a door? If it were, then there
was another room here only a few feet from her.</p>
<p>Timidly she caught hold of the metal ring the
next moment and pulled; to her disappointment,
the panel did not move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a reason for this ring and this
panel,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try again, harder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Putting her shoulder against the panel, she
pushed with all her strength. There was a sudden,
loud, grating noise; then the door swung
open with such force that she lost her balance
and fell full length on the floor.</p>
<p>Her first thought was about her flashlight.
What a terrible plight she would be in if it were
broken! Trembling with anxiety, she pressed the
button of her light. Out flashed its rays as
brightly as ever. Half curiously, half timidly
she stared into the lighted area.</p>
<p>The next instant her eyes dilated in terror.
What was that horrible-looking creature directly
in front of her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-o-oh!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;Jo! Jo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that one shriek her throat contracted
with fright, and she lay as if paralyzed.</p>
<p>That horrible thing was so near she could almost
touch it. Was it man&mdash;or beast&mdash;some prehistoric
animal? She had never&mdash;not even in her
wildest imagination&mdash;seen anything like this
hideous monster. It stood in an upright position
like a man and had long scrawny arms and legs,
and huge frightful claws which seemed to be
reaching out to grab her. Its head was hunched
between its shoulders, and over the whole thing
was a long, scraggly, hairlike covering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>With eyes fastened on the creature Peggy
waited breathlessly. If only the thing would
move or do something! Anything would be better
than this suspense. But still it stood&mdash;motionless.
If only she could manage to slide or crawl
out of the room! But that monster would be sure
to follow stealthily. Yet she must do something.
She <i>must</i> get out of this room.</p>
<p>Forcing her eyes for a second from the monster,
she glanced toward the door. The next instant
she shuddered in fresh terror. There beside
the door, almost at her feet, loomed another monster,
taller and more horrible than the first.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously there came a soft thudding
sound from the tunnel. What could that be?
Some other menace? It was getting nearer&mdash;nearer.</p>
<p>Suddenly above the thudding sounded a high-pitched
voice&mdash;Jo Ann&rsquo;s voice! Jo and Florence
were running to her rescue! They had heard her
scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must get out of this room this instant
and warn the girls of their danger,&rdquo; she commanded
herself sternly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Carefully, slowly, almost without seeming to
move, she backed feet first toward the door. To
reach it she had to pass so close to this other
taller and more horrible creature that she would
almost touch it. She held her breath. Already she
could feel the clutch of those clawlike hands.</p>
<p>Steeling herself, she inched her body a little
nearer. Out of the corner of her eye she watched
those threatening claws. Brown leathery claws
they were&mdash;dried&mdash;wrinkled&mdash;ghastly.</p>
<p>All at once the reason for their ghastly appearance
darted into her mind&mdash;the hideous creatures
were <i>dead</i>!</p>
<p>With a cry of relief she sprang to her feet and
stumbled through the door. Just as she stepped
into the tunnel, Jo Ann and Florence rushed up,
panting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peg&mdash;what&rsquo;s&mdash;the matter?&rdquo; Jo Ann cried,
throwing her arms around Peggy. &ldquo;I was afraid
something dreadful&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did happen, Peg?&rdquo; urged Florence between
gasps for breath as she flashed her light
full upon Peggy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Struggling to make her voice sound natural,
Peggy replied slowly, &ldquo;I&mdash;was&mdash;just scared. I&rsquo;m&mdash;sorry&mdash;I
frightened you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What frightened you?&rdquo; Jo Ann put in
quickly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re white as a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been seeing&mdash;ghosts! Ugh!&rdquo;
Peggy shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no time for foolishness. What scared
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peep through that door and see for yourself,
then,&rdquo; Peggy replied.</p>
<p>All curiosity, Jo Ann turned quickly toward
the open door, Florence at her heels. The next
moment both girls drew back with cries of
fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; ejaculated Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; echoed Jo Ann. &ldquo;No wonder you
were frightened, Peg,&rdquo; she added quickly.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re only mummies, but if I hadn&rsquo;t read
about them I&rsquo;d have been paralyzed. But what
made you come up here after you said you&rsquo;d stay
where we left you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I got tired waiting for you&mdash;I thought you&rsquo;d
never come&mdash;so I decided to explore this tunnel
a little way. I got lost for a while; and then on
my way back I found this door. It wouldn&rsquo;t open
at first, so I pushed hard&mdash;and then I tumbled
head foremost into that room. When I turned on
my light and saw those horrible creatures&mdash;well,
I &rsquo;most died from fright. I thought they were
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor child,&rdquo; comforted Florence. &ldquo;We
should never have left you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you two stay so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went farther than we expected, and Jo
got stuck in a hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy turned to Jo Ann. &ldquo;You would do something
like that! What kind of a hole was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little opening in a cave-in. I wanted
to see what was on the other side. I dropped my
flashlight over there and got stuck trying to get
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to pull her out&mdash;I had a time doing
it,&rdquo; Florence added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t nearly as much trouble as I got
into,&rdquo; said Peggy with a gesture toward the door.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;d those hideous things ever get in there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; replied Jo Ann.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read that they&rsquo;ve been found in some parts
of Mexico, and that they&rsquo;re different from the
ancient Egyptian mummies in that no preservatives
were used. The air in certain parts of this
country has such drying qualities in it that centuries
ago people discovered that they could keep
bodies perfectly without the use of preservatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! They don&rsquo;t look perfect to me,&rdquo; put in
Peggy.</p>
<p>Jo Ann stepped to the door, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to examine those mummies more closely,
but&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way we feel, don&rsquo;t we, Florence?&rdquo;
Peggy said with a half smile as she and Florence
crowded into the doorway. &ldquo;What is that whitish
stuff on them?&rdquo; she asked the next moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine they were wrapped in a sort of
shroud when they were put in there,&rdquo; said Jo
Ann, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s almost evaporated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you suppose they&rsquo;re standing straight
up, Jo?&rdquo; Peggy queried curiously. &ldquo;I should
think they&rsquo;d be in coffins, or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann shook her head dubiously. &ldquo;Some
ancient custom, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you start out to find the family skeleton,
Jo?&rdquo; asked Florence, with a twinkle in her
eyes. &ldquo;It seems to me Peggy found it, and all of
its ancestors, for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy shuddered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing I didn&rsquo;t
know there were so many mummies in this room.
Let&rsquo;s get away from here. I&rsquo;ve seen enough of
these horrible-looking things to last me a lifetime.
You have, too, haven&rsquo;t you, Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence nodded an emphatic assent and
added, &ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;ve looked at them long
enough, Jo. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly Jo Ann turned to leave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to go inside and look over the room, but since
you insist, I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ll have to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy took a few steps down the passage, calling
back over her shoulder, &ldquo;Shut the door, Jo.
I found it closed, so we&rsquo;d better leave it that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Jo Ann caught hold of the ring
and pulled on it, but the door would not budge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>After pulling on it several more times without
success she called out, &ldquo;The door&rsquo;s stuck&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
have to try pushing. Catch hold of the ring and
pull, Peg, while I push, and, Florence, you shine
your light in here so I can see,&rdquo; she added as she
stepped into the room.</p>
<p>Bracing herself against the wall, she slipped
her arm into the narrow space behind the door
and began pushing. With one wary glance at
the ghostly figures back of her, Peggy pulled
vigorously on the ring.</p>
<p>Suddenly the door gave a loud grating noise
and swung so quickly that Peggy lost her balance
and fell back against the mummies. With a terrified
shriek she sprang back.</p>
<p>At the same instant Jo Ann felt something
hard bump against her leg as she tumbled back
against the wall. Guessing what had happened
to Peggy, she reached for her flashlight hanging
to her belt. No sooner had she flashed on the
light than Peggy was by her side, shivering and
pale with fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! I fell against those hideous mummies!&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here this instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something struck me, too,&rdquo; said Jo Ann,
glancing down in the corner back of the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>There before her eyes lay several large candelabra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look here, Peg!&rdquo; she cried excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just old iron candlesticks,&rdquo; Peggy replied
shortly. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not heeding Peggy&rsquo;s words, Jo Ann reached
down and picked up one of them and began examining
it closely. &ldquo;I believe this is gold&mdash;a
golden candelabrum!&rdquo; she exclaimed admiringly.
&ldquo;Look at the lovely design on the base&mdash;and
aren&rsquo;t the branches beautifully shaped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Florence peered around the half-open
door and called out, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to
you two? Why don&rsquo;t you come on out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made a wonderful discovery,&rdquo; replied
Jo Ann. &ldquo;Come here and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Florence came inside Jo Ann
pointed triumphantly to the candelabra.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gold&mdash;maybe solid gold!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s tribute of silence Florence
remarked, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re beautiful. I don&rsquo;t believe
they&rsquo;re all gold; those darker ones are probably
silver and tarnished with age.&rdquo; She reached
down and lifted one of the duller-looking candelabra.
&ldquo;It certainly is heavy. Isn&rsquo;t this design
on the base exquisite?&rdquo; As she placed it back on
the floor she added, &ldquo;I believe all these belong
to the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably they were hidden here long ago
during some war or revolution and then forgotten,&rdquo;
Jo Ann said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Maybe the persons
who put them here were killed, and so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She stopped abruptly, then began again, &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if there were more valuable
things hidden down here. I want to see, too, if
there aren&rsquo;t steps leading up to the church. Come
on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">THE BLACK BOX</span></h2>
<p>Past the ghostly figures the three girls made
their way, nervous shivers running up and down
their spines in spite of the fact that they knew
these figures would not harm them.</p>
<p>As they threw the rays from their lights on
the rear wall of the room, Jo Ann suddenly
halted. &ldquo;This wall&rsquo;s different from the others,&rdquo;
she announced. &ldquo;It looks as if it&rsquo;s made of stone
panels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly does,&rdquo; agreed Florence.</p>
<p>Eagerly Jo Ann began examining one of the
panels, testing it to see if it would move. Following
her example, Peggy and Florence began trying
to move the ones nearest them. Each panel,
they discovered, had a slight depression carved
in the top, which served as a fingerhold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>After they had worked for several minutes
without success, Peggy said disgustedly, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
stop this foolishness and get out of this awful
room. These panels look like vaults or tombs&mdash;like
the ones we saw in that old St. Roch&rsquo;s Cemetery
in New Orleans. I&rsquo;ve seen enough spooks
and family skeletons to do me for ages.&rdquo; She
tugged at Jo Ann&rsquo;s arm impatiently.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously Jo Ann exclaimed,
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve found a panel that moves! Shine your
light this way, Peg, while Florence helps me to
shove it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together Jo Ann and Florence pushed vigorously
on the panel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! It&rsquo;s moving!&rdquo; ejaculated Jo Ann
finally. &ldquo;Once more, Florence&mdash;hard, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy threw the rays from her flashlight directly
into the narrow crack now appearing below
the stone. &ldquo;Oh, I see something&mdash;something
white! Push the stone up a little higher, can&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; Turning suddenly to Florence, she
ordered, &ldquo;You hold the light and let me push.
I&rsquo;m stronger than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few more moments there was a loud grating
sound as the stone moved, and the crack below
widened several inches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in there, all right,&rdquo; agreed
Florence. &ldquo;If you promise not to let that stone
drop on my hand, I&rsquo;ll reach in and get it. Can
you hold it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get a better hold first!&rdquo; cried Jo Ann.
&ldquo;My hand&rsquo;s slipping. Now, are you ready,
Peg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly Florence reached through the crack.
&ldquo;Feels like a box!&rdquo; she exclaimed excitedly. &ldquo;But
I can&rsquo;t get it out. There&rsquo;s a roll of paper or something,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll push a little harder,&rdquo; said Jo Ann.
&ldquo;Push, Peg&mdash;with all your might. Now&mdash;can
you&mdash;get hold&mdash;of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got them!&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s voice was triumphant.
&ldquo;Hold it just another second so I can see
if there&rsquo;s anything else.&rdquo; She flashed the light
into the opening again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; cut in Peggy. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t&mdash;hold this
thing&mdash;much longer. It weighs a ton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything else,&rdquo; Florence said a
moment later. &ldquo;Let it go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With sighs of relief Jo Ann and Peggy let the
slab drop into place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew&mdash;that stone was heavy!&rdquo; gasped
Peggy. She glanced disappointedly at the small
black box and roll of paper which Florence held
in her hand. &ldquo;And all that hard work for nothing
but a little insignificant-looking box and a
piece of paper! I told you these were nothing
but grave vaults. Let&rsquo;s get out of this cemetery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After one last glance around the room Jo Ann
followed Peggy and Florence to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad the door&rsquo;s not stuck this time,&rdquo; she
remarked as she pulled it shut.</p>
<p>As she turned to join the girls Florence called,
&ldquo;Look right down this passage, Jo. There&rsquo;s another
cave-in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flashing her light in that direction, Jo Ann
exclaimed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&mdash;that is a cave-in.
There&rsquo;ve been steps there, too. This must&rsquo;ve
been the passage leading up into the church. It
looks as if the whole side of the building has
fallen down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where we are, then,&rdquo; Florence put in.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re right under that section of the church
that&rsquo;s partly in ruins. That&rsquo;s the reason no one&rsquo;s
been down here in years and years.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Now that her curiosity was satisfied about the
passage to the church, Jo Ann turned to Florence.
&ldquo;You still have the box and the paper you
took out of that vault, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they don&rsquo;t look at all interesting or
valuable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one glance at the dull black box Jo Ann
reached out and took the roll of papers from
Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; she sighed a moment later,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;re all in Spanish, of course. This is the
queerest writing&mdash;all fancy flourishes and curly-cues.
I can&rsquo;t make anything out of it, can you,
Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence looked down at the papers a moment,
then shook her head. &ldquo;All that I can make
out of it is that it&rsquo;s some kind of old record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have a look at the box, then. Maybe
it&rsquo;ll explain something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Florence handed it to Jo Ann she remarked,
&ldquo;If you can find out anything from this
old black box, you&rsquo;re a good one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thoroughly agree with you. It doesn&rsquo;t look
at all interesting.&rdquo; Jo Ann turned the box from
side to side. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unusually heavy, though, for
such a small box.&rdquo; She shook it vigorously. &ldquo;Listen!
There&rsquo;s something inside that makes a little
rattling noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be anything much&mdash;not in that small
box,&rdquo; commented Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could open it,&rdquo; said Jo Ann, studying
the box while Florence held the light. &ldquo;It
must have a secret spring&mdash;there&rsquo;s no sign of a
keyhole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret spring!&rdquo; Peggy&rsquo;s interest was instantly
aroused. &ldquo;Let me see it, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Peggy reached out to take the box, its
weight took her by surprise, and she let it slip
out of her hands and fall crashing to the floor.</p>
<p>Dropping down on their knees, Jo Ann and
Peggy reached for the box at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&mdash;oh!&rdquo; gasped Jo Ann, her voice quivering
with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&mdash;oh!&rdquo; echoed Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Florence asked quickly as she
leaned over their shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Spellbound the three girls gazed before them.
The insignificant black box lay on its side, wide
open, part of its contents spilled out on the floor.
There was the gleam of old gold and the brilliant
sparkle and flash of fire. All the colors of
the rainbow seemed reflected in that circle of
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How perfectly magnificent!&rdquo; ejaculated
Peggy in an awed voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful! An old jewel case!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jo Ann, entranced by the beauty before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gorgeous!&rdquo; added Florence.</p>
<p>One by one, as though afraid of touching
them, the girls picked up the jewels from the
floor. Rings set with precious stones&mdash;diamonds,
rubies, sapphires, opals gorgeous as the sunset&mdash;necklaces,
earrings, and chains of gold. Queer,
antique-looking, all of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this the loveliest thing you ever laid
your eyes on!&rdquo; cried Peggy, holding up a filigree
necklace of such delicate workmanship that it
resembled a piece of fine old lace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exquisite,&rdquo; agreed Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look at this ring&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it the most beautiful
one you ever saw?&rdquo; Jo Ann held up a ring
that had one large exquisite opal circled by tiny
diamonds. &ldquo;I love opals. The opal&rsquo;s my birthstone.
When my ship comes in&mdash;if it ever does&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
try to buy me a ring just like this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is lovely. They all are&mdash;the diamonds,
rubies, all of them,&rdquo; added Florence. &ldquo;They
must be very valuable. I wonder why they were
hidden here. Oh!&rdquo; she cried suddenly, an expression
of horror passing over her face. &ldquo;These belong
to the church. We can&rsquo;t take them&mdash;that&rsquo;d
be stealing. We must put them right back where
we found them this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Peggy emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would be the sense of leaving these
things hidden for another century or more?&rdquo; put
in Jo Ann quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I still feel that we&rsquo;ll be
stealing if we take them,&rdquo; insisted Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what we&rsquo;d better do!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo
Ann as a sudden solution of the problem occurred
to her. &ldquo;We can take them to Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez
and let him dispose of them in the
proper legal manner. Don&rsquo;t you think that would
be best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;perhaps so,&rdquo; slowly agreed Florence.
&ldquo;He ought to know what would be right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>While Florence and Jo Ann had been arguing
about what to do with the pieces of jewelry,
Peggy was putting them back in the black box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get all these things back in this box,&rdquo;
she sighed finally. &ldquo;How in the world did they
ever get so much in such a small box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! Don&rsquo;t close it. We might not be able
to get it open again.&rdquo; Jo Ann reached over and
took the box. &ldquo;Let me tie this string around it
so nothing&rsquo;ll spill out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes the box was securely tied.
Holding it tightly, Jo Ann hastened back to the
entrance to the tunnel, the other girls following
closely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">MORE PRECIOUS THAN JEWELS</span></h2>
<p>At the very moment that Peggy was lying
terror-stricken at the feet of the mummies Dr.
Blackwell had just made an alarming discovery.</p>
<p>He had been wakened from a deep peaceful
sleep by the sound of vigorous knocking on the
outer door and had quickly scrambled out of
bed and into his clothes. He well knew that this
knocking meant that someone was in distress and
needed his professional services. Louder and
louder had come the sound. Fearing that everyone
in the house would be awakened, he had hurried
down to answer the door.</p>
<p>When he had not seen Florence at the head
of the stairs, waiting to bolt the door as usual,
he had gone to her room and found it empty
and the beds undisturbed. Immediately he had
run from room to room, calling the girls, but
had heard only the echoes of his own worried
voice. All three girls had utterly disappeared!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>A terrible fear swept over him&mdash;they had
been kidnaped! But no, that was impossible, he
told himself the next moment. Three strong,
healthy girls could not be carried off without
making a sound.</p>
<p>What should he do? Call the police? Something
must be done immediately, but there was
so much red tape connected with governmental
affairs in this country that it would be hours before
anything could be done. Perhaps it would
be better to call his good friend Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez.
He would advise him the best steps to take.</p>
<p>Quickly, his hand shaking so he could scarcely
write, he scribbled a note to the Se&ntilde;or. It was
almost illegible, but the words, &ldquo;Come at once&rdquo;
were plain, and that was all that was necessary.</p>
<p>Rushing down the stairs, he hurried past the
man waiting at the door, without speaking. The
man stared after him in blank amazement. What
was the matter? Was the <i>Doctor Americano
loco</i>?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>On across the street ran Dr. Blackwell to the
corner of the Plaza, where a taxi could be found
at any hour of the day or night.</p>
<p>He shook the sleeping taxi driver by the shoulder.
&ldquo;<i>Hombre, hombre</i>, wake up! Take this letter
to the Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez and bring him back
with you. <i>Muy pronto, sabe?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lazy, easy-going Mexican straightened in
surprise. He had carried this American doctor
on many an urgent call, but he had never seen
him so nervous and excited before. This must be
something very important. Very well, he would
show <i>el doctor</i> how he could hurry. There was a
roar, the grinding of gears, and the car was off
like a shot.</p>
<p>In an amazingly short time Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez
rushed into the office. He found Dr. Blackwell
slumped in a chair, his face in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor, what has happened? What is the
matter?&rdquo; he asked in Spanish.</p>
<p>In a few halting words Dr. Blackwell told
him of the girls&rsquo; disappearance. &ldquo;What shall I
do, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; he ended, his voice vibrant with
emotion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Before the amazed Se&ntilde;or could take in the
situation and answer this question, there was the
sound of light, flying feet on the balcony floor.</p>
<p>The next moment, after one swift glance at
her father, Florence dropped on her knees at his
feet, exclaiming, &ldquo;Daddy! Are you sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Startled at the sound of her voice, Dr. Blackwell
almost jumped out of his chair. &ldquo;Florence!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Florence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Daddy?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>In the moment of silence that followed her
question she turned to Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez. &ldquo;Tell
me what&rsquo;s happened, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you come from?&rdquo; Dr. Blackwell
put in before the Se&ntilde;or could speak. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d
you get here? Oh, child, I&rsquo;ve been so frightened
and worried! I thought something terrible had
happened to you and the girls. Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here,&rdquo; answered Jo Ann, who had just
come running in with Peggy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;blame
Florence&mdash;it&rsquo;s really&mdash;all my fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dad, there&rsquo;s nothing the matter with
us&mdash;we&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; said Florence, rising. &ldquo;We
just went up on the roof and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>are</i> you girls talking about?&rdquo; he demanded,
noticing for the first time their disreputable
appearance&mdash;their grimy faces, Jo&rsquo;s
bloodstained shirt, and their knickers. &ldquo;What
have you been doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been solving the mystery,&rdquo; eagerly
explained Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mystery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the mystery of that strange little window
in the back of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you get out of the house without
unbolting the door? You know better than to go
out at this hour of night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scold, Dad,&rdquo; begged Florence. &ldquo;We
haven&rsquo;t been down on the street. We climbed
through the little window and found a tunnel
under the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tunnel!&rdquo; he repeated, bewildered. &ldquo;What
in the world are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s a long tunnel that starts under
the back of our house and goes under the street,
clear to the church&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t know how much
farther&mdash;there&rsquo;s a regular network of passages,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>While Florence stopped to catch her breath,
her father turned to Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez. &ldquo;Do you
know anything about a tunnel under the street?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez shook his head, a puzzled
expression on his face.</p>
<p>By that time Florence had started talking
again, her words tumbling over each other in
her hurry. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve found lots of valuable
things&mdash;candelabra&mdash;old papers&mdash;and jewels!
Real jewels! Diamonds&mdash;rubies. Open the box,
Jo, and show them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With fingers fumbling in her haste Jo Ann
was already untying the string about the box.
Her eyes shining, she turned its contents upon a
chair in front of Dr. Blackwell. Under the
bright lights the jewels sparkled far more brilliantly
than they had in the tunnel.</p>
<p>In the silence that followed, the three girls
waited breathlessly. What would Dr. Blackwell
and the Se&ntilde;or say about their discovery? Would
they be forgiven now for the anxiety they had
caused?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>After a long pause Dr. Blackwell gently
pulled Florence down on the arm of his chair.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re beautiful,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I shudder to
think of the risks you three took to get them&mdash;of
what might have happened to you. No one would
ever have known where you were. I&rsquo;m so thankful
to have you all back safe and sound. You&rsquo;re
far more precious to me than these jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, doctor, it wasn&rsquo;t as dangerous as it
sounds,&rdquo; put in Jo Ann eagerly. &ldquo;We were very
careful.&rdquo; Recalling some of her moments of
anxiety in the past few hours, she hesitated and
added a little less confidently, &ldquo;Perhaps it was
more dangerous than we realized, but we&rsquo;re all
right now, and we wanted so badly to solve the
mystery of that window and to surprise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile passed over Dr. Blackwell&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;You surprised me all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encouraged by this change of expression on
the doctor&rsquo;s face, Jo Ann went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you
were worried. We thought we&rsquo;d get back before
you discovered we were gone. You&rsquo;ll forgive us,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dr. Blackwell replied slowly, &ldquo;provided
you all promise never to risk your precious
lives that way again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll promise that, won&rsquo;t we, girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence and Peggy nodded an emphatic assent.</p>
<p>With a wave of her hand toward the jewels
Jo Ann added, &ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;ve explored that
tunnel and found all these, we&rsquo;re satisfied.&rdquo; She
turned then and handed Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez the
old yellowed papers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be interested
in these papers. They look like old records.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curiously the Se&ntilde;or unrolled one of the old
documents and began reading it. Soon he was
poring over them, oblivious of everything else.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the girls examined the jewels
more closely and reveled in their beauty.</p>
<p>Dr. Blackwell interrupted their chatter finally,
saying, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been able to piece
together all your disjointed account of your adventures.
Suppose you begin at the first, Jo, since
you were the originator of the whole thing, and
tell the whole story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>Jo Ann needed no second invitation. She began
at once to give a vivid account of their getting
the rope and their climb to the roof; then
went on to their descent into the hidden room
and the tunnel; and finally to the discovery of
the candelabra, papers, and jewelry. With the
help of Peggy and Florence not even the smallest
detail was left untold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An amazing tale,&rdquo; Dr. Blackwell commented
when they had finished, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m still shuddering
about the risks you took.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eager to change the subject, Jo Ann turned to
Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez and asked, &ldquo;Can you make
anything out of these papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mees Jo.&rdquo; There was a tinge of excitement
in the Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s voice in spite of his attempt
to appear calm. &ldquo;Dey are ver&rsquo; old records and I
t&rsquo;ink may be ver&rsquo; valuable. One hab de name of
my gran&rsquo;modder&rsquo;s family. If dey are what I t&rsquo;ink&mdash;ah,
dat would be wonderful! Somet&rsquo;ing dat
has been lost for many, many years&mdash;how you
say in Ingles?&mdash;de missing link? Wid your permission
I would like to take dem to my office
and study dem.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what we want you to do. I can
hardly wait to find out more about them. We
would like your advice, too, about what to do
with all these beautiful things.&rdquo; She gestured
toward the jewels and then, reaching over,
picked up the opal ring that had so fascinated
her. &ldquo;This is the most beautiful opal I&rsquo;ve ever
seen, and it&rsquo;s set so artistically. I&rsquo;m glad my
birthday&rsquo;s in October, so it&rsquo;s not unlucky for me
to wear an opal, since I&rsquo;m particularly fond of
that stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Se&ntilde;or smiled. &ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s your lucky stone,
try this ring on, Mees Jo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obediently Jo Ann slipped the ring on her
finger. &ldquo;Oh, se&ntilde;or, it&rsquo;s lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she was still admiring it, Peggy picked
up the filigree necklace. &ldquo;This is the daintiest
piece of all, I think,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the most beautiful, according to
my notion,&rdquo; smiled Florence, pointing to a
bracelet of old gold set with sapphires and tiny
diamonds. &ldquo;The sapphire is my birthstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez was much pleased by the
girls&rsquo; admiration. &ldquo;De people of my country are
ver&rsquo; artistic,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Dey make many beautiful
t&rsquo;ings.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To whom do you think all these jewels and
things belong?&rdquo; Jo Ann asked. &ldquo;And why were
they put in that room under the church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mees Jo, I do not know. I am ver&rsquo; sorry dat
I cannot answer you dat. I have heard dat long
ago in de wars de people carried der most valuable
t&rsquo;ings to de church for safe keeping. I may
be able to find out who owns dese from de papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure these jewels are very valuable,&rdquo; Dr.
Blackwell remarked in Spanish to the Se&ntilde;or.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m away so much that I don&rsquo;t like to leave the
girls alone with them in the house. Would you
take charge of them till you find out to whom
they belong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez nodded. &ldquo;Yes, if you wish,
doctor. I will be glad to take them and put them
in my safe till I find out to whom they belong.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">THE SE&Ntilde;OR&rsquo;S STORY</span></h2>
<p>In the days that followed the discovery of the
papers and jewels the girls were all impatience
to hear from Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez. Jo Ann especially
was restless. Always she had disliked
inaction, and now she wanted to find out everything
&ldquo;right straight away.&rdquo; She failed to realize
that the Se&ntilde;or was having to search through
scores of old city records for information, and
that, like a true Spaniard, he was thorough&mdash;painstakingly
accurate in every detail.</p>
<p>Again and again the three girls talked over
that eventful night and the unanswered questions&mdash;Why
had those things been hidden in that
underground room? Why had no one found
them before? To whom did they belong?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Since we found those things under the
church, they probably belong to the church,&rdquo; Jo
Ann declared thoughtfully one morning in one
of these discussions. Her eyes suddenly began to
shine as she added, &ldquo;I know what I wish they&rsquo;d
do if the jewels belong to them&mdash;sell them and
take the money to restore that part of the building
that&rsquo;s in ruins. The people are too poor to
have it repaired. Such an old historic building
ought not to be allowed to fall into decay. Then,
if there were any money left after the repairing
was done, it could be used for a special relief
fund for the poor people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are both fine ideas,&rdquo; approved Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had enough money to buy that
lovely filigree necklace, if the jewels are sold,&rdquo;
put in Peggy. Her face lengthened. &ldquo;I know,
though, it&rsquo;d be more expensive than I could
afford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to have that beautiful opal ring,&rdquo;
spoke up Jo Ann wistfully.</p>
<p>Florence half sighed as she added, &ldquo;That
bracelet with my birthstone and the tiny diamonds
was so attractive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>To the girls&rsquo; delight at lunch that day Dr.
Blackwell announced that at four o&rsquo;clock Se&ntilde;or
Rodriguez was coming over to tell them what he
had found out about the records and jewels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, but I&rsquo;m glad!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann. &ldquo;I
was beginning to think he&rsquo;d never come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By half-past three the girls were waiting
eagerly in Dr. Blackwell&rsquo;s office for the Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s
coming. Peggy and Florence chatted gaily with
Dr. Blackwell, but Jo Ann kept glancing nervously
at her watch. She felt that this was one of
the most important events in her whole life. If
only she could be instrumental in restoring that
old church&mdash;that would be wonderful!</p>
<p>At last voices were heard in the hall, and
Felipe ushered in Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez and, to their
surprise, Padre Ignacio.</p>
<p>As soon as greetings had been exchanged,
Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez placed the yellowed papers on
the table and beside them the jewel box, which
no longer was black, but bright and shining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the box is silver!&rdquo; thought Jo Ann,
amazed, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s had it polished till it&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez was all lawyer now&mdash;dignified
and formal. &ldquo;My dear young ladies, I haf
de honor of congratulate you on de wonderful
discovery you haf made,&rdquo; he began in his broken
English, bowing to each of the girls. &ldquo;Dese are
ver&rsquo; valuable papers which you haf found&mdash;ver&rsquo;
valuable to de city, ver&rsquo; valuable to de church
and to my family,&rdquo; he added, smiling.</p>
<p>The girls smiled back happily. They didn&rsquo;t
understand all that he was talking about or why
they should receive so much praise, but evidently
their discovery was more important than
they had realized.</p>
<p>He then went on to explain how, after searching
through the archives of the city, studying old
records, and checking names and dates, he felt
that he could give some authentic information
about the papers.</p>
<p>They were records dating before 1846 of some
of the oldest most prominent families of the
city. Several of the older inhabitants with whom
he had talked remembered having heard their
parents tell of the exciting times when the city
had been besieged by the American forces under
General Zachary Taylor. As soon as they had
realized they could hold out no longer against
the Americans, they had hidden their most valuable
possessions, of which only a small part had
ever been recovered. Tales of vast treasures hidden
under the city had been handed down from
generation to generation, but few of them seemed
to have any foundation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dis General Guerrero whose name you see
on dis paper,&rdquo; continued the Se&ntilde;or, picking up
one of the papers, &ldquo;was de fadder of my esteemed
gran&rsquo;fadder. Dey are de records of de families
of Guerrero and Rodriguez before 1846. Finding
dem will clear de titles to some ver&rsquo; valuable
property which belong to my family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, se&ntilde;or, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; exclaimed Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are, too, aren&rsquo;t we, Peggy?&rdquo; added Jo
Ann.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>The Se&ntilde;or went on to say that when he showed
the jewels and papers to his grandmother, she
recalled a story told to her in her childhood by
her mother just before she died. According to
this story her husband, General Guerrero, at the
time of the siege, had given her some important
papers which he had told her to guard above
everything. When the general had realized that
the city could no longer hold out, he had sent a
messenger with a hastily written note telling her
to send those valuable papers and their jewels to
him by this man. She had reluctantly handed
the papers and jewels to the messenger, but that
was the last she had ever heard or seen of them.
As the general had been killed that same day,
she supposed the things had been either lost or
stolen. For that reason no effort was ever made
to recover them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And dese are de papers dat were lost,&rdquo; finished
the Se&ntilde;or. &ldquo;How ver&rsquo; fortunate it is dat you
find dem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could they have ever got in that
secret underground room?&rdquo; asked Florence.</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez shook his head. &ldquo;Dat I do
not know. I t&rsquo;ink perhaps someone carry dem to
de <i>padre</i>, and he hide dem along wid odder
valuable t&rsquo;ings which had been sent to him. De
tunnels under de church had been used for carrying
reinforcements and food to de army at de
outskirts of de city. Dat is why dey could hold
out so long against de American forces.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder we couldn&rsquo;t find the other end of
the tunnel!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann. &ldquo;It must be several
miles long.&rdquo; She turned to Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez.
&ldquo;Do the jewels belong to your family, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, dat I do not know. Some of dem I t&rsquo;ink
belong to my family, but it is impossible to be
sure. My gran&rsquo;modder say she sure dis little ring&mdash;dis
little ring you admire so much, Mees Jo&mdash;was
her Gran&rsquo;modder Guerrero&rsquo;s ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on to explain how, since they had no
way of finding exactly to whom the jewels had
belonged, they had decided it would be better to
return them to the church, as it had been very
poor for years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann, her eyes shining.
&ldquo;Will there be enough money then to repair
that old ruined part of the church? I think
an old historic building like that ought to be
restored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Se&ntilde;or smiled approvingly. &ldquo;Dat is a ver&rsquo;
good plan, Mees Jo. De <i>padre</i> and I haf already
discuss dat.&rdquo; He went on to add that the jewels
alone would not be sufficient to furnish funds for
the restoring of the building, but that some of
the old papers cleared up titles to valuable property
belonging to the church, and that from this
property enough could be secured for that purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re going to do that!&rdquo; rejoiced
Jo Ann. &ldquo;That old church has held a fascination
for me from the first time I saw it. To
think that we girls will have a part in restoring
it&mdash;that is wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they can use those beautiful candelabra
we found,&rdquo; put in Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they restore that part of the building,
they&rsquo;ll open the passage to those underground
rooms, and it&rsquo;ll be easy to get the candelabra out
then,&rdquo; said Jo Ann. She turned to the Se&ntilde;or and
the <i>padre</i>. &ldquo;You might find more valuable
things down there&mdash;we didn&rsquo;t search thoroughly.&rdquo;
She stopped a moment, then added,
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t there be enough money to help those poor
people who attend the church?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Rodriguez nodded. &ldquo;We hope so&mdash;we
want ver&rsquo; much to do that.&rdquo; He turned and
translated Jo Ann&rsquo;s words to the <i>padre</i>, who also
nodded approvingly. &ldquo;Padre Ignacio and I are
ver&rsquo; happy dat you young ladies are so much interes&rsquo;
in our people,&rdquo; the Se&ntilde;or added then, &ldquo;and
we would like to do somet&rsquo;ing to show you how
much we appreciate what you haf done&mdash;so&mdash;we
haf decide to give you each what you like
best of de jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls exchanged swift glances of surprise.</p>
<p>He poured out the jewels on the table. &ldquo;I believe
Mees Peggy like dis necklace&mdash;is it not
so?&rdquo; He handed her the filigree necklace she
had admired so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; gasped Peggy, staring wide-eyed
at the bit of loveliness in her hands. &ldquo;You
mean this is really mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, Mees Peggy. It is wid much pleasure dat
I present it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Mees Florencita, did you not say you
like dis bracelet?&rdquo; He placed the jewel-set
bracelet in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but se&ntilde;or, that is too valuable to give to
me,&rdquo; protested Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; he replied, patting her on the
shoulder. &ldquo;It is of no value compare to what you
haf done for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Mees Jo, will you please to come
here one moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With cheeks flushed from excitement Jo Ann
rose from her chair and came over to the Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you, my most estimable friend,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;you who haf been so much interes&rsquo; in our city&mdash;in
de history of our country, and who&mdash;how
do you say it?&mdash;ah, figure t&rsquo;ings out&mdash;who haf
accomplis&rsquo; somet&rsquo;ing dat seem impossible and
restore to us dese ver&rsquo; valuable papers, we want
to give dis token of appreciation&mdash;dis little
ring.&rdquo; He held up the beautiful opal and diamond
ring that Jo Ann had selected as her favorite
of all the jewels. &ldquo;I t&rsquo;ink that this once belonged
to my great-great-gran&rsquo;modder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s eyes shone starlike. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful&mdash;beautiful&mdash;but
it&rsquo;s such a valuable heirloom&mdash;to
give to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is an heirloom, I want all de more
to give it to you, my friend.&rdquo; The Se&ntilde;or smiled
warmly over at her. &ldquo;Let me put it on your finger.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>All happiness, Jo Ann held out her right hand,
and the Se&ntilde;or slipped the ring on her third finger
with all the dignity of a ceremonial. With
equal dignity she bowed and said slowly, &ldquo;I
thank you very much for this wonderful gift and
for the honor of wearing your ancestor&rsquo;s ring.&rdquo;</p>
